Use a PagerDuty notifier to use all the incident management features of PagerDuty with Axiom.

## Benefits of using PagerDuty with Axiom

- Increase the performance and availability of your apps and services.
- Use specific insights in your backend, apps, and workloads by running PagerDuty in tandem with Axiom.
- Detect critical issues before any disruption happens to your resources: Axiom automatically opens and closes PagerDuty incidents.
- Obtain deep understanding of the issue root cause by visualising the data using Axiom.

Axiom creates PagerDuty events that arise from critical issues, disruptions, vulnerabilities, or workloads downtime on a service created in PagerDuty. The alert on Axiom side is linked to the PagerDuty Event allowing for Axiom to automatically close the Event incident if the Alert is resolved. This ensures no duplicate Events on PagerDuty side are created for the corresponding ones on Axiom side.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Admin base role](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/user-roles) in PagerDuty.

## Create PagerDuty notifier

To create a PagerDuty notifier, follow these steps:

1. In PagerDutyâ€™s Events V2 API, create a new service named **Axiom** with the default settings. Copy the integration key. For more information, see the [PagerDuty documentation](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/services-and-integrations#create-a-service)
1. In Axiom, click the **Monitors** tab, and then click **Manage notifiers** on the right.
1. Click **New notifier** on the top right.
1. Name your notifier.
1. Click **Slack**.
1. Enter the integration key you have previously generated.
1. Click **Create**.

You can now add your PagerDuty notifier to a specific monitor in Axiom. If any incident happens on your monitor, Axiom notifies you on the PagerDuty Service Activity dashboard.

## How automatic incident resolution works

Axiom automatically opens and closes PagerDuty incidents based on your monitor state. This ensures that incidents in PagerDuty accurately reflect the current state of your system without manual intervention.

### Incident lifecycle

When you configure a threshold monitor with a PagerDuty notifier in Axiom, the following happens:

<Steps>
<Step title="Incident creation">
When your monitor enters the **Alarm** state (the threshold condition is met), Axiom sends a `trigger` event to PagerDuty. This creates a new incident in PagerDuty with a unique deduplication key that links the incident to your specific monitor.
</Step>

<Step title="Automatic resolution">
When your monitor returns to the **OK** state (the threshold condition is no longer met), Axiom automatically sends a `resolve` event to PagerDuty using the same deduplication key. This automatically resolves the open incident in PagerDuty.

<Note>
For automatic resolution to work, your monitor must return to the OK state. The monitor continues to run on its configured schedule, and when the query results no longer meet the threshold condition, Axiom automatically resolves the PagerDuty incident.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Duplicate prevention">
The deduplication key ensures that if the same monitor triggers multiple times while already in an alarm state, PagerDuty doesn't create duplicate incidents. All notifications for the same alarm are linked to the original incident.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting auto-resolution

If incidents in PagerDuty aren't automatically resolving when your monitor clears:

- **Verify the monitor returns to OK**: Check your monitor's status in Axiom. The monitor must evaluate to OK for the resolution event to be sent.
- **Check monitor configuration**: Ensure your monitor is configured correctly and runs on a regular schedule. If the monitor is disabled or deleted, resolution events aren't sent.
- **Review PagerDuty service settings**: Confirm that the PagerDuty service accepts `resolve` events. Some PagerDuty services have settings that prevent automatic resolution.
