Use a custom webhook notifier to connect your monitors to internal or external services. The webhook URL receives a POST request with a content type of `application/json` together with any other headers you specify.

To create a custom webhook notifier, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Monitors** tab, and then click **Manage notifiers** on the right.
1. Click **New notifier** on the top right.
1. Name your notifier.
1. Click **Custom webhook**.
1. In **Webhook URL**, enter the URL where you want to send the POST request.
1. Optional: To customize the content of your webhook, use the Go template syntax to interact with these variables:
    - `.Action` has value `Open` when the notification corresponds to a match monitor matching or a threshold monitor triggering, and has value `Closed` when the notification corresponds to a threshold monitor resolving.
    - `.MonitorID` is the unique identifier for the monitor associated with the notification.
    - `.Body` is the message body associated with the notification. When the notification corresponds to a match monitor, this is the matching event data. When the notification corresponds to a threshold monitor, this provides information about the value that gave rise to the monitor triggering or resolving.
    - `.Description` is the description of the monitor associated with the notification.
    - `.QueryEndTime` is the end time applied in the monitor query that gave rise to the notification.
    - `.QueryStartTime` is the start time applied in the monitor query that gave rise to the notification.
    - `.Timestamp` is the time the notification was generated.
    - `.Title` is the name of the monitor associated with the notification.
    - `.Value` is the value that gave rise to the monitor triggering or resolving when the notification corresponds to a threshold monitor.
    - `.MatchedEvent` is the event that matched the criteria of a match monitor.
1. Optional: Add headers to the POST request sent to the webhook URL.
1. Click **Create**.

## Example

The example below is a custom webhook notification generated from a threshold monitor triggering. The body of a POST request sent to the webhook URL using the default template is the following:

```json
{
  "action": "Open",
  "event": {
    "monitorID": "CabI3w142069etTgd0",
    "body": "Current value of 57347 is above or equal to the threshold value of 0",
    "description": "",
    "queryEndTime": "2024-06-28 14:55:57.631364493 +0000 UTC",
    "queryStartTime": "2024-06-28 14:45:57.631364493 +0000 UTC",
    "timestamp": "2024-06-28 14:55:57 +0000 UTC",
    "title": "Axiom Monitor Test Triggered",
    "value": 57347,
    "matchedEvent": null
  }
}
```
