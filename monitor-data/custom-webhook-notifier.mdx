### Custom webhook

Create customizable webhook notifiers to connect to internal or external services.

The webhook URL receives an HTTP/HTTPS POST request with a content type of `application/json` together with any other headers you specify.

Use the following variables to define the content of your webhook:

- `.Action` has value `Open` when the notification corresponds to a match monitor matching or a threshold monitor triggering, and has value `Closed` when the notification corresponds to a threshold monitor resolving.
- `.MonitorID` is the unique identifier for the monitor associated with the notification.
- `.Body` is the message body associated with the notification. When the notification corresponds to a match monitor, this is the matching event data. When the notification corresponds to a threshold monitor, this provides information about the value that gave rise to the monitor triggering or resolving.
- `.Description` is the description of the monitor associated with the notification.
- `.QueryEndTime` is the end time applied in the monitor query that gave rise to the notification.
- `.QueryStartTime` is the start time applied in the monitor query that gave rise to the notification.
- `.Timestamp` is the time the notification was generated.
- `.Title` is the name of the monitor associated with the notification.
- `.Value` is the value that gave rise to the monitor triggering or resolving when the notification corresponds to a threshold monitor.

Use the Go template syntax to interact with these variables when defining a custom body for your webhook.

A sample webhook body is shown below. This applies the default template shown on creating a custom webhook to a sample notification generated from a threshold monitor triggering.

```json
{
  "action": "Open",
  "event": {
    "monitorID": "CabI3w142069etTgd0",
    "body": "Current value of 57347 is above or equal to the threshold value of 0",
    "description": "",
    "queryEndTime": "2024-06-28 14:55:57.631364493 +0000 UTC",
    "queryStartTime": "2024-06-28 14:45:57.631364493 +0000 UTC",
    "timestamp": "2024-06-28 14:55:57 +0000 UTC",
    "title": "Axiom Monitor Test Triggered",
    "value": 57347,
    "matchedEvent": null
  }
}
