A monitor is a background task that periodically runs a query that you define. For example, it counts the number of error messages in your logs over the previous 5 minutes. A notifier defines how Axiom notifies you about the monitor output. For example, Axiom can send you an email.

You can use the following types of monitor:

- [Anomaly monitors](/monitor-data/anomaly-monitors) aggregate event data over time and look for values that are unexpected based on the event history. When the results of the aggregation are too high or low compared to the expected value, Axiom sends you an alert.
- [Match monitors](/monitor-data/match-monitors) filter for key events and send them to you.
- [Threshold monitors](/monitor-data/threshold-monitors) aggregate event data over time. When the results of the aggregation cross a threshold, Axiom sends you an alert.
