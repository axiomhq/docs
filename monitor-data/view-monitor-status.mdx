To view the status of a monitor:
1. Click the Monitors tab.
1. Click the monitor in the list whose status you want to view.

The monitor status page provides an overview of the monitor’s current status and history.

## View recent activity and history of runs

On the left, you see the recent activity and the history of the monitor runs:
- The `_time` field displays the time of the monitor run.
- The `Status` field displays the status of the monitor.
- The `Range from` and `Range to` fields display the time range used in the monitor run.

You can change the time range of this overview in the top right corner.

## View information about monitor configuration

On the right, you see information about the monitor’s configuration.
- Current status
- Monitor type
- Query the monitor periodically runs
- Configuration details
- Notifiers attached to the monitor
- Metadata such as name and description

## Check recent viewers of monitor status

The status page displays the initials of the users who have recently looked at the monitor. To check which users have recently viewed the status page of monitors, hold the pointer over the initials in the top right of the page.

For example, this can be useful if you want to know who has recently seen that a monitor had been triggered and you can start a conversation with them to understand what’s happening.
