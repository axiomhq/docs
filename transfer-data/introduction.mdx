A flow is a way to transfer and transform data from an Axiom dataset to a destination that you choose. For example, you can use flows to retain the complete record of all events in Axiom while transferring high-value app events to a costly SIEM.

The **Flows** tab allows you to move and transform data using APL and provides you with a unified experience that streamlines your data workflows.

## Elements of a flow

A flow consists of three elements:
- A source. This is the Axiom dataset from which you transfer and transform data.
- A transformation. This is the APL query you use to shape your data.
- A destination. This is where you transfer the data.

After creating a flow, replay it for a specified time range to transfer the matching and transformed data to the destination.

To get started with flows, see [Flows](/transfer-data/flows).
