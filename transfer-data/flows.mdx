A flow is a way to transfer and transform data from an Axiom dataset to a destination that you choose. This page explains how to set up a flow.

- Set up a destination. For more information, see [Destinations](/transfer-data/destinations).

## Set up a flow

To set up a flow:
1. Click the **Flows** tab. Axiom displays the list of flows you have created.
2. In the top right, click **New flow**.
3. In the **Source** section, specify the source dataset and the transformation in an APL query. For example, the following APL query selects events from the `cloudflare-logpush` dataset and transforms the data by deleting and adding a field.

    ```kusto
    // Transfer high-value app events to a costly SIEM
    // while retaining the complete record of all events in Axiom.
    ['cloudflare-logpush']
    | where QueryName == "app.axiom.co."
    // Reduce events by dropping unimportant field
    | project-away ['@app']*
    // Enrich events with additional context
    | extend ['@origin'] = "_axiom"
    ```

    <Note>
    If you only specify the name of the dataset in the query, Axiom transfers all the raw data to the destination.
    </Note>

4. Click **Preview** to check whether the query you specified transforms your data as you want it. The **Input event** section displays the original data stored in Axiom. The **Output event** section displays the transformed data that Axiom sends to the destination. The raw data in Axiom isnâ€™t affected by the transformation.
5. In the **Destinations** section, click **Add destination**, and then select the destination where you want to transfer the transformed data. To add several destinations, click **+** in the top right corner.
6. In the top right, click **Create**.

## Replay a flow

After creating a flow, replay it for a specified time range to transfer the matching and transformed data to the destination.

To replay the flow:

1. Click the **Flows** tab. Axiom displays the list of flows you have created. Select the flow that you want to replay.
2. In the top right, click **Run replay**.
3. Specify the time range, and then click **Replay flow**.

As a result, Axiom runs the query on the source data for the specified time range, and then transfers the results of the query to the destination.
