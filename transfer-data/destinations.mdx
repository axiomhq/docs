</Note>

To transfer and transform data from an Axiom dataset to a destination, you need to set up a destination. This is where data is transferred. Once you set up a destination, you can use it in any flow.

To set up a destination:
1. Click the **Flows** tab. Axiom displays the list of flows you have created.
2. In the top right, click **Manage destinations**, and then click **New destination**.
3. Name the destination.
4. In **Kind**, select the destination type.
5. Configure the destination. For more information on each destination type, see the following:

    - [AWS S3](#configure-aws-s3-destination)
    - [Axiom](#configure-axiom-dataset-destination)
    - [Azure](#configure-azure-destination)
    - [Elastic Bulk](#configure-elastic-bulk-destination)
    - [HTTP](#configure-http-destination)
    - [HTTP (Authorization)](#configure-http-authorization-destination)
    - [HTTP (Basic)](#configure-http-basic-destination)
    - [OpenTelemetry Traces](#configure-opentelemetry-traces-destination)

6. In the bottom right, click **Save**.

## Configure AWS S3 destination

1. In AWS, ensure the AWS Policy contains the statements required to perform a `PutObject` operation. For more information, see the AWS documentation on [policies and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html), [access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html), and the [`PutObject` operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html).
2. In Axiom, configure the following:

    - **Access key ID**. For more information on access keys, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).
    - **Secret access key**. For more information on access keys, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).
    - In **Region**, enter the bucket region. For more information on bucket properties, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/view-bucket-properties.html).
    - In **Bucket**, enter the bucket name. For more information on bucket properties, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/view-bucket-properties.html).

## Configure Axiom dataset destination

1. Create a destination dataset in Axiom where you want to transfer the data.
2. Create an Axiom API token with permissions to update the destination dataset.
3. Configure the following:

    - In **Dataset**, enter the name of the destination dataset.
    - In **Token**, enter the Axiom API token.
    - In **URL**, enter `https://api.axiom.co/` if you use the default region, and enter `https://api.eu.axiom.co/` if you use the EU region.

## Configure Azure destination

1. In Azure, create a service principal account with authorization to perform a `Put Blob` operation. For more information, see the Azure documentation on [creating a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal) and on [authorizing a `Put Blob` operation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/put-blob?tabs=microsoft-entra-id#authorization).
2. In Axiom, configure the following:
    - In **URL**, enter the path to the storage account.
    - In **Format**, specify the format in which Axiom sends data to the destination. For example, CSV or JSON.
    - In **Tenant ID**, enter the directory ID. For more information on getting the tenant ID, see the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal#sign-in-to-the-application).
    - In **Client ID**, enter the app ID. For more information on getting the app ID, see the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal#sign-in-to-the-application).
    - In **Client secret**, enter the app secret. For more information on creating a client secret, see the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal#option-3-create-a-new-client-secret).

## Configure Elastic Bulk destination

1. In Elastic, ensure your account has the index privileges to use the create action. For more information, see the [Elastic documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html#docs-bulk-api-prereqs).
2. In Axiom, configure the following:
    - In **URL**, enter the path to the Elastic Bulk API where you want to transfer data. For example, enter `https://api.elastic-cloud.com/` if you use Elastic Cloud.
    - In **Index**, enter the Elastic index.
    - In **Username** and **Password**, enter your Elastic login credentials.

## Configure HTTP destination

Configure the following:

- In **URL**, enter the path to the HTTP destination where you want to transfer data.
- Optional: In **Format**, specify the format in which Axiom sends data to the destination. For example, CSV or JSON.
- Optional: In **Headers**, specify any headers you want Axiom to send to the destination.

## Configure HTTP (Authorization) destination

Configure the following:

- In **URL**, enter the path to the HTTP destination where you want to transfer data.
- Optional: In **Format**, specify the format in which Axiom sends data to the destination. For example, CSV or JSON.
- In **Authorization header**, specify the value of the HTTP `Authorization` request header. For example, `Basic 123`. For more information, see the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization).
- Optional: In **Headers**, specify any headers you want Axiom to send to the destination.

## Configure HTTP (Basic) destination

Configure the following:

- In **URL**, enter the path to the HTTP destination where you want to transfer data.
- Optional: In **Format**, specify the format in which Axiom sends data to the destination. For example, CSV or JSON.
- In **Username** and **Password**, enter your login credentials to the HTTP destination.
- Optional: In **Headers**, specify any headers you want Axiom to send to the destination.

## Configure OpenTelemetry Traces destination

Configure the following:

- In **URL**, enter the path to the OpenTelemetry Traces destination where you want to transfer data.
- Optional: In **Headers**, specify any headers you want Axiom to send to the destination.
