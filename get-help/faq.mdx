## About Axiom

Axiom is logging re-invented for high-scale engineering teams:

- **Cloud-native architecture** delivers higher performance at lower costs.
- **Built-in distributed tracing** provides E2E visibility and faster problem resolution.
- **Integrated data routing** ends vendor lock-in.
- **Option to deploy Axiom in your cloud** for unlimited log management at a fixed price.

Axiom is a log management and analytics solution that reduces the cost and management overhead of logging as much data as you want.

## Axiom’s unique approach

Axiom’s mission is to operationalize every bit of event data in your organization. Axiom frees you from having to ignore or delete data due to cost considerations, whatever its source.

With Axiom, you no longer need to choose between data and costs. Axiom has been built from the ground up to allow for highly efficient data ingestion and storage. A zero-to-infinite query scaling that allows you to query all your data, all the time.

Many organizations use Axiom for continuous monitoring and observability, as well as an event store for running analytics and deriving insights from all their event data.

### Differences from other logging solutions

The limitations of other logging solutions are the following:

- Other logging solutions tend to place restrictions on how much data you can collect, either on purpose or as a side effect of their architectures.
- There is a non-trivial cost in increasing your data ingest as clusters need to be scaled.
- You need to make a choice between hot and cold data, and about what you archive. This means that your data is in two or three different places and your queries can be fast or slow depending on where the data is.
- You need to carefully limit the data that you ingest and/or sample your data to keep costs under control.

The following makes Axiom different:

- Decoupled ingest and querying pipelines.
- Stateless ingest pipeline that requires minimal compute/memory to storage.
- Ingest all data into object storage, enabling the cheapest storage possible for all ingested data.
- Query scale-out with cloud functions, requiring no constantly running servers waiting for a query to be processed. Instead, enjoy zero-to-infinity querying instantly.

### Benefits of Axiom’s approach

- The most efficient ingestion pipeline for massive amounts of data.
- Store more data for less by exclusively using inexpensive object storage for all data.
- Query all data at any time, irrespective of its age.
- Reduce the total cost of ownership of your log management and analytics pipelines with simple scale and maintenance.
- Free your organization to do more with its event data.

## Start using Axiom

There are different ways you can start using Axiom.

### Try Axiom without registration

To get started with Axiom straight away, go to the interactive [Axiom Playground](https://play.axiom.co/) and check out the [Get started guide](/getting-started-guide/getting-started).

### Try Axiom for free

Axiom’s Personal plan is free forever with a generous allowance. It is available to all customers. All you need to do is [create an Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/register).

### Choose pricing plan

Axiom offers transparent pricing with no hidden fees.

- **Personal plan:** Axiom’s free forever Personal plan is available to all customers.
- **Team plan:** With unlimited users included starting at $25/month, Axiom’s Team plan is a great choice for growing companies and for Enterprise organizations who want to run a proof-of-concept. The Team plan is billed on a monthly basis.
- **Enterprise plan:** Axiom’s Enterprise plan tailors the license details to your organization’s needs. The Enterprise plan is billed on an annual basis.

For more information, see [Pricing](https://axiom.co/pricing).

## Choose deployment option

Axiom offers two deployment options:

- **Axiom Cloud:** Axiom manages compute and storage in its cloud. Axiom Cloud is available for all pricing plans.
- **Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC):** Compute and storage operate in your private cloud, while Axiom handles updates. BYOC is available as an additional feature for the Enterprise plan.

### Run Axiom in your own cloud

Axiom enables you to store data in your own storage with the Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) feature. You provide your own S3-compatible object storage, and the Axiom control plane handles ingest, query execution, and all other background tasks. This is not an on-premises solution, but it enables you to maintain control over your data at rest.

Using Axiom as a cloud SaaS product without the BYOC option is safe, affordable, and the best choice for most use cases. Billed month-to-month on our Team plan for ingest workloads up to 50TB/mo, and with no upper limit on our annual Enterprise plan, Axiom supports tens of thousands of organizations today. However, if you are a large enterprise customer and your organization requires data sovereignty for compliance reasons or secondary workloads, using Axiom with the BYOC premium option is the answer.

## Get your data into Axiom

Axiom accepts data from numerous sources without pre-processing. It stores events at full fidelity, making them queryable in their original format or with schemas applied at query time.

You can likely point your existing collectors to Axiom, such Vector, Cribl, OpenTelemetry, Fluent Bit, or Fluentd. For the complete list of supported data sources, see [Send data]((/send-data/ingest).

## Query and route data

After sending your data to Axiom, you can query it using the Axiom Processing Language (APL), a proprietary query language optimized for timestamped event data. APL similar to Kusto or Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL), and more advanced than SQL. For more information, see [Introduction to APL](/apl/introduction).

## Retain data

The data retention period determines how long Axiom stores your data. By default, the data retention period is defined by your pricing plan and is the same for all datasets:

- **Personal plan** provides a generous 30 days of retention.
- **Team plan** provides 95 days of retention, ensuring a complete picture of your data for over 3 months.
- **Enterprise plan** allows you to customize the data retention period to your needs, with the option for unlimited retention so your organization has access to all its data, all the time.

You can [specify shorter retention periods](/reference/datasets#change-data-retention-period) for individual datasets.

For more information, see [Pricing](https://axiom.co/pricing).

## Feature states

Each feature of Axiom is in one of the following states:

- **In development:** Axiom is actively building this feature. It’s not available yet but it’s progressing towards Preview.
- **Private preview:** An early-access feature available to selected customers which helps Axiom validate the feature with trusted partners.
- **Public preview:** The feature is available for everyone to try but may have some rough edges. Axiom is gathering feedback before making it GA.
- **Generally available (GA):** The feature is fully released, production-ready, and supported. Feel free to use it in your workflows.
- **Planned end of life:** The feature is scheduled to be retired. It’s still working but you should start migrating to alternative solutions.
- **End of life:** The feature is no longer available or supported. Axiom has sunset it in favor of newer solutions.

<Warning>
Private and public preview features are experimental, are not guaranteed to work as expected, and may lead to data loss. Please consider the risk you run when you use preview features in your production environment.
