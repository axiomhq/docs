## About Axiom

Axiom is a log management and analytics solution that reduces the cost and management overhead of logging as much data as you want.

With Axiom, you no longer need to choose between data and costs. Axiom has been built from the ground up to allow for highly efficient data ingestion and storage. A zero-to-infinite query scaling that allows you to query all your data, all the time.

Many organizations use Axiom for continuous monitoring and observability, as well as an event store for running analytics and deriving insights from all their event data.

## Axiom’s unique approach

Axiom’s mission is to operationalize every bit of event data in your organization. Axiom frees you from having to ignore or delete data due to cost considerations, whatever its source.

### Differences from other logging solutions

The limitations of other logging solutions are the following:

- Other logging solutions tend to place restrictions on how much data you can collect, either on purpose or as a side effect of their architectures.
- There is a non-trivial cost in increasing your data ingest as clusters need to be scaled.
- You need to make a choice between hot and cold data, and about what you archive. This means that your data is in two or three different places and your queries can be fast or slow depending on where the data is.
- You need to carefully limit the data that you ingest and/or sample your data to keep costs under control.

The following makes Axiom different:

- Decoupled ingest and querying pipelines.
- Stateless ingest pipeline that requires minimal compute/memory to storage.
- Ingest all data into object storage, enabling the cheapest storage possible for all ingested data.
- Query scale-out with cloud functions, requiring no constantly running servers waiting for a query to be processed. Instead, enjoy zero-to-infinity querying instantly.

### Benefits of Axiom’s approach

- The most efficient ingestion pipeline for massive amounts of data.
- Store more data for less by exclusively using inexpensive object storage for all data.
- Query all data at any time, irrespective of its age.
- Reduce the total cost of ownership of your log management and analytics pipelines with simple scale and maintenance.
- Free your organization to do more with its event data.

## Start using Axiom

There are different ways you can start using Axiom.

### Try Axiom without registration

To get started with Axiom straight away, go to the interactive [Axiom Playground](https://play.axiom.co/) and check out the [Get started guide](/getting-started-guide/getting-started).

### Try Axiom for free

Axiom’s Personal plan is free forever with a generous allowance. It is available to all customers. All you need to do is [create an Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/register).

### Choose pricing plan

Axiom’s free forever Personal plan

- **Team plan:** With unlimited users included starting at $25/month, Axiom’s Team plan is a great choice for growing companies and for Enterprise organizations who want to run a proof-of-concept. The Team plan is billed on a monthly basis.
- **Enterprise plan**: Axiom’s Enterprise plan tailors the license details to your organization’s needs. The Enterprise plan is billed on an annual basis.

### Run Axiom in your own cloud

Axiom enables you to store data in your own storage with the Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) feature. You provide your own S3-compatible object storage, and the Axiom control plane handles ingest, query execution, and all other background tasks. This is not an on-premises solution, but it enables you to maintain control over your data at rest.

Using Axiom as a cloud SaaS product without the BYOC option is safe, affordable, and the best choice for most use cases. Billed month-to-month on our Team plan for ingest workloads up to 50TB/mo, and with no upper limit on our annual Enterprise plan, Axiom supports tens of thousands of organizations today. However, if you are a large enterprise customer and your organization requires data sovereignty for compliance reasons or secondary workloads, using Axiom with the BYOC premium option is the answer.

Axiom BYOC is available exclusively on our annual Enterprise plan.

For more information, see [Pricing](https://axiom.co/pricing).

## Data retention

Axiom’s free forever Personal plan provides a generous 30 days of retention.

Axiom’s Team plan provides 95 days of retention, ensuring a complete picture of your data for over 3 months.

Retention on Axiom’s Enterprise plan can be customised to your needs, with the option for unlimited retention so your organization has access to all its data, all the time.
