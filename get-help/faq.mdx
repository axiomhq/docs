This page aims to offer a deeper understanding of Axiom. If you can’t find an answer to your questions, please feel free to  [contact our team](https://axiom.co/contact).

## What is Axiom?

Axiom is a log management and analytics solution that reduces the cost and management overhead of logging as much data as you want.

With Axiom, organizations no longer need to choose between their data and their costs. Axiom has been built from the ground up to allow for highly efficient data ingestion and storage, and then a zero-to-infinite query scaling that allows you to query all your data, all the time.

Organizations use Axiom for continuous monitoring and observability, as well as an event store for running analytics and deriving insights from all their event data.

Axiom consists of a datastore and a user experience that work in tandem to provide a completely unique log-management and analytics experience.

## What are Axiom's deployment options?

Axiom offers two deployment options:
- **Axiom Cloud:** A fully managed cloud service with usage-based pricing.
- **Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC):** Deploy Axiom in your own cloud environment with a predictable annual platform fee.

## Can I run Axiom in my own cloud/infrastructure?

Axiom enables you to store data in your own storage in one of the following ways:

- **Bring Your Own Bucket (BYOB):** BYOB is a feature you can request as an add-on if you’re on the Axiom Cloud plan. You provide your own S3-compatible object storage, and the Axiom control plane handles ingest, query execution, and all other background tasks. This is not an on-premises solution, but it enables you to maintain control over your data at rest.
- **Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC):** BYOC is an alternative deployment option and pricing plan. We deploy Axiom into your own AWS infrastructure, and you store and process data in your own environment.

## How do I choose between Axiom Cloud and BYOC?

Choose Axiom Cloud if you prefer quick setup, usage-based pricing, and don’t need to keep data in your own cloud environment.

Choose BYOC if you require data isolation, have compliance requirements necessitating data storage in your environment, can benefit from your cloud provider’s volume discounts, or have very large-scale workloads.

For more information, see [Pricing](https://axiom.co/pricing).

## What regions are available for Axiom Cloud deployments?

Axiom Cloud offers deployments in both US and EU regions. For more information, see [Regions](/reference/regions).

## Can I migrate from Axiom Cloud to BYOC later?

Yes, Axiom can support migration between deployment options. The Axiom team can assist with this process. If you expect to require a migration, we recommend reaching out to our team in advance.

## How is Axiom different than other logging solutions?

At Axiom, our goal is that no organization has to ignore or delete a single piece of data no matter its source: logs, events, frontend, backends, audits, etc.

We found that existing solutions would place restrictions on how much data can be collected either on purpose or as a side-effect of their architectures.

For example, state of the art in logging is running stateful clusters that need shared knowledge of ingestion and will use a mixture of local SSD-based storage and remote object storage.

### Side-effects of legacy vendors

1. There is a non-trivial cost in increasing your data ingest as clusters need to be scaled and more SSD storage and IOPs need to be provided

2. The choice needs to be made between hot and cold data, and also what is archived. Now your data is in 2-3 different places and queries can be fast or slow depending on where the data is

The end result is needing to carefully consider all data that is ingested, and putting limits and/or sampling to control the DevOps and cost burden.

### The ways Axiom is different

1. Decoupled ingest and querying pipelines

2. Stateless ingest pipeline that requires minimal compute/memory to storage as much as 1.5TB/day per vCPU

3. Ingests all data into object storage, enabling the cheapest storage possible for all ingested data

4. Enables querying scale-out with cloud functions, requiring no constantly-running servers waiting for a query to be processed. Instead, enjoy zero-to-infinity querying instantly

### The benefits of Axiom’s approach

1. The most efficient ingestion pipeline for massive amounts of data

2. Store more data for less by exclusively using inexpensive object storage for all data

3. Query data that’s 10 milliseconds or 10 years old at any time

4. Reduce the total cost of ownership of your log management and analytics pipelines with simple scale and maintenance that Axiom provides

5. Free your organization to do more with it’s data

## How long can I retain data with Axiom?

The free forever Personal plan provides a generous 30 days of retention.

The Axiom Cloud and the Bring Your Own Cloud plans allow you to customize the data retention period to your needs, with the option for “Forever” retention so your organization has access to all its data, all the time.

For more information, see [Pricing](https://axiom.co/pricing).

## Can I try Axiom for free?

Yes. The Personal plan is free forever with a generous allowance. It is available to all customers.

With unlimited users included, the Axiom Cloud plan starting at $25/month is a great choice for growing companies and for enterprise organizations who want to run a proof-of-concept.

For more information, see [Pricing](https://axiom.co/pricing).

## How is Axiom licensed?

The Axiom Cloud plan is billed on a monthly basis.

For the Bring Your Own Cloud plan, the platform fee is billed on an annual basis.
