Monitor the operational status of Axiom services and subscribe to updates about incidents and maintenance windows.

## Access the status page

Axiom provides a public status page that shows the current operational status of all Axiom services:

**Status page**: [https://status.axiom.co](https://status.axiom.co)

The status page displays:

- **Overall system status**: Indicates whether all systems are operational
- **Component status**: Shows the status of individual Axiom components including:
  - Axiom API (US and EU regions)
  - Axiom app (US and EU regions)
  - Data ingestion services
  - Query services
  - Authentication services
- **Incident history**: Past incidents and their resolutions
- **Scheduled maintenance**: Upcoming planned maintenance windows

## Component-level subscriptions

Subscribe to updates for specific Axiom components to receive notifications about incidents affecting those components:

<Steps>
<Step title="Visit the status page">
Go to [https://status.axiom.co](https://status.axiom.co).
</Step>

<Step title="Click Subscribe to Updates">
In the top right corner, click **Subscribe to Updates**.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose your notification method">
Select how you want to receive updates:
- **Email**: Receive incident notifications via email
- **SMS**: Get text message alerts (requires phone number)
- **Slack**: Connect your Slack workspace
- **Webhook**: Configure a webhook URL for programmatic notifications
- **RSS/Atom**: Subscribe to the feed in your RSS reader
</Step>

<Step title="Select components">
Choose which components you want to monitor. For example:
- Select **Axiom API - US** if your organization is in the US region
- Select **Axiom API - EU** if your organization is in the EU region
- Select **Data Ingestion** if you want to be notified about ingestion issues

<Tip>
Subscribe only to components relevant to your organization's region and usage to avoid unnecessary notifications.

## Monitor dataset availability with alerts

To monitor whether your datasets are receiving data as expected, create a monitor in Axiom:

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Monitors">
In the Axiom app, click the Monitors tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a threshold monitor">
Click **New monitor**, and then select **Threshold monitor**.
</Step>

<Step title="Write a query">
Create a query that counts events in your dataset. For example:

```kusto
['your-dataset']
| summarize count() by bin(_time, 5m)
```

This query counts events in 5-minute intervals.
</Step>

<Step title="Set threshold">
Configure the threshold to alert when the count falls below your expected rate. For example:
- **Threshold**: 1
- **Comparison**: below
- **Frequency**: Check every 5 minutes
- **Range**: Look at the last 5 minutes

This configuration alerts you if no events arrive in a 5-minute window.
</Step>

<Step title="Add notifier">
Select how you want to be notified (email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.).

For more information, see [Notifiers](/monitor-data/notifiers-overview).
</Step>

<Step title="Save and enable">
Give your monitor a descriptive name like "Dataset ingestion check" and save it.

<Check>
You'll now receive alerts if your dataset stops receiving data.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Adjust the time intervals and thresholds based on your expected ingestion rate. For datasets with lower event rates, use longer time windows.
</Tip>
