## API tokens

You can use the Axiom API and CLI to programmatically ingest data and manage your organisation settings. For example, you can add new notifiers and change existing monitors with API requests. To prove that these requests come from you, you must include forms of authentication called tokens in your API requests. One form of authentication is an API token. API tokens let you control the actions that can be performed with the token. For example, you can specify that requests authenticated with a certain API token can only query data from a particular dataset.

For more information, see [Tokens](/reference/tokens).

## Role-Based Access Control

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows you to manage and restrict access to your data and resources efficiently. You can control access to your data with groups, roles, and users.

For more information, see [Access](/reference/settings).

## Manage data sources

Manage the ways you send data to Axiom such as apps, datasets, and endpoints.

For more information, see [Manage data sources](/reference/manage-data-sources).

## Configure organization

Configure organization settings such as Axiom AI, pricing plan, and Axiom usage.

For more information, see [Organization settings](/reference/organization-settings).

## Configure user profile

Configure aspects of your Axiom account such as your timezone, the editor mode, and personal access tokens. 

For more information, see [Configure user profile](/reference/profile).
