Audit logs allow you to track who did what and when within your Axiom organization.

Tracking activity in your Axiom organization with audit logs is useful for legal compliance reasons. For example, you can investigate the following:

- Track who has accessed the Axiom platform.
- Track organization access over time.
- Track data access over time.

Audit logs also make it easier to manage your Axiom organization. They allow you to do the following, among others:

- Track changes made by your team to your observability posture.
- Track monitoring performance.

Audit logs are available to all users. Enterprise customers can query audit logs for the full time range. Other customers can query audit logs for the previous three days.

## Explore audit logs

1. Go to the **Explore** tab, and then click **APL**.
2. Query the `axiom-audit` dataset. For example, run the query `['axiom-audit']` to display the raw audit log data in a table.
3. Optional: Customize your query to filter or summarize the audit logs. For more information, see [Explore data](/query-data/explore).
4. Click **Run**.

The `action` field specifies the type of activity that happened in your Axiom organization.

## Restrict access to audit logs

To restrict access to audit logs, use Axiomâ€™s role-based access control to define who can access the `axiom-audit` dataset. For more information, see [Access](/reference/settings#access-overview).
