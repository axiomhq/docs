Audit logs allow you to track who did what and when within your Axiom organization.

Tracking activity in your Axiom organization with audit logs is useful for legal compliance reasons. For example, you can investigate the following:

- Track who has accessed the Axiom platform.
- Track organization access over time.
- Track data access over time.

Audit logs also make it easier to manage your Axiom organization. They allow you to do the following, among others:

- Track changes made by your team to your observability posture.
- Track monitoring performance.
- Track billable usage.

Audit logs are available to all users. Enterprise customers can query audit logs for the full time range. Other customers can query audit logs for the previous three days.
