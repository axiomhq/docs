Axiom is available in multiple regions to help you comply with data residency requirements and optimize performance. You can decide where your data is stored and processed.

Axiom’s unified multi-region platform supports data residency requirements:

- **Data storage**: Data is stored exclusively in the region assigned to each dataset.
- **Data processing**: Query execution happens within the dataset’s region.
- **Metadata**: Control plane metadata is managed by the unified platform but data payloads stay regional.
- **Compliance**: Supports GDPR and other regional data protection requirements.

## Available regions

Axiom currently supports the following cloud regions:

| Region     | Base domain of edge ingest API endpoints         | Example                                           | Cloud provider |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| US         | `https://us-east-1.aws.edge.axiom.co` | `https://us-east-1.aws.edge.axiom.co/v1/ingest/DATASET_NAME`    | AWS |
| EU         | `https://eu-central-1.aws.edge.axiom.co` | `https://eu-central-1.aws.edge.axiom.co/v1/ingest/DATASET_NAME` | AWS |

The base domain of other API endpoints is `https://api.axiom.co`.

<Info>
Axiom is developing support for additional regions. [Contact Axiom](https://www.axiom.co/contact) if you need a region that’s not currently supported.

## Default region

The default region of your organization is where new datasets are created by default. If your organization has multiple regions, you can specify a different region when [creating a dataset](/reference/datasets#create-a-dataset).

To determine your organization’s default region:

1. Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > General**.
1. Find your organization’s default region in the **Region** section.

## Add regions

If you’re on the Axiom Cloud plan, you can add regions to your organization. For more information, see [Manage add-ons](/reference/usage-billing#manage-add-ons).

## Choose region

When you create a new organization or dataset, choose the region that best meets your data residency requirements and where your infrastructure is located for optimal performance.

When choosing a region, consider the following factors:

- **Data residency requirements**: If you need to comply with regulations like GDPR that require data to be stored in specific regions, choose the appropriate region.
- **Performance**: Choose the region closest to your infrastructure for lower latency.
- **Team location**: Choose the region that your team is primarily located in for better performance.

## Roadmap

### Legacy infrastructure: Dedicated regional instances

Until November 2025, Axiom operated completely separate infrastructures for different regions:

- **US instance**: `app.axiom.co` hosted in AWS `us-east-1`
- **EU instance**: `app.eu.axiom.co` hosted in AWS `eu-central-1`

Each instance was entirely independent with separate:
- Organizations and user accounts
- Billing and subscription plans
- API endpoints and ingestion URLs
- Data storage and query infrastructure

Limitations:
- Organizations could only exist in one region.
- No way to manage data across regions from a single account.
- Required separate logins for US and EU data.
- Complex billing and administration for multi-regional teams.

### Towards a unified multi-region platform

Starting in November 2025, Axiom is rolling out support for a unified platform where a single organization can manage datasets across multiple regions:

- **One organization, multiple regions**: Create and manage datasets in different geographic regions from a single account.
- **Unified billing**: Single subscription covering all your regions.
- **Cross-region visibility**: View and manage all your data from one console.
- **Flexible data residency**: Place each dataset in the region that best meets your compliance and performance requirements.

### Migration from legacy EU instance

The unified multi-region model is rolling out progressively. If your organization currently uses the legacy EU instance, Axiom will migrate you to the unified platform.

No action is required from you. Axiom will migrate your organization to the unified platform seamlessly with no downtime.

## Enhanced query isolation coming soon

Axiom currently enforces regional data isolation at query time. This means that you can’t query datasets from different regions in a single query

Axiom is actively developing advanced query isolation capabilities. For example, queries will intelligently route to the correct region based on dataset location. These improvements will maintain data residency compliance while enhancing query performance and developer experience.
