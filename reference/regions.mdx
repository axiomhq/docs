Axiom is available in multiple regions to help you comply with data residency requirements and optimize performance.

## Towards a unified multi-region platform

Axiom is rolling out support for a unified platform where a single organization can manage datasets across multiple regions. This will give you complete control to decide where your data is stored and processed.

### Current capabilities

- You choose the default region when you create a new organization.
- You can choose from two available regions: US and EU. Support additional regions is coming soon.
- You can’t change the default region after creating the organization.
- Axiom stores the data you ingest in the default region of your organization.
- When you run a query, the query executes in your region, but Axiom routes the query results through the US region. This means that when you query data stored the EU region, the query results leave the EU region.

The current implementation is useful if you want to ingest data to the EU region, but your query results can leave the EU region. If your organization has data sovereignty requirements that are stricter than the current implementation, Axiom recommends waiting for the next phase of the rollout before migrating.

### Roadmap

Axiom rolls out its unified multi-region platform in phases. This approach ensures you can migrate when the capabilities align with your specific data residency requirements.

1. Complete data locality (coming soon)

    - Axiom routes query results through the same region where data is stored.
    - Monitor and dashboard operations respect organization region boundaries.
    - Full compliance with regional data protection requirements (for example, GDPR).

    In this phase, if your organization requires EU data sovereignty, you’ll be able to migrate with confidence.

1. Unified multi-region platform (in development)

    - One organization managing datasets across multiple geographic regions.
    - Choose a default region for your organization, add regions to your organization, and configure individual datasets to store data in one of your regions.
    - Unified billing covering all your regions.

    In this phase, regions function as self-contained units that coexist within one organization while preserving data sovereignty guarantees.

Axiom routes some of your personal data (for example, email and name when you log in) through US servers, and this won’t change in the rollout of the multi-region platform.

Your view can help shape this roadmap. [Contact Axiom](https://www.axiom.co/contact) if you need a region that’s not currently supported or if you have any other suggestions.

## Available regions

Axiom currently supports the following cloud regions for data ingest:

<BaseDomains />

<Note>
The base domain of all other API endpoints is `https://api.axiom.co`.

## Determine default region

The default region of your organization determines where Axiom stores your data.

To determine your organization’s default region:

1. Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > General**.
1. Find your organization’s default region in the **Region** section.

## Choose region

When you create a new organization, choose the region that best meets your data residency requirements and where your infrastructure is located for optimal performance.

When choosing a region, consider the following factors:

- **Data residency requirements**: If you need to comply with regulations like GDPR that require data to be stored in specific regions, choose the appropriate region.
- **Performance**: Choose the region closest to your infrastructure for lower latency.
- **Team location**: Choose the region that your team is primarily located in for better performance.

## Legacy infrastructure

Until November 2025, Axiom operated separate infrastructures for two dedicated regional instances:

| Instance   | Base domain of Axiom Console   | Base domain of API endpoints         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| US         | `https://app.axiom.co`         | `https://api.axiom.co` |
| EU         | `https://app.eu.axiom.co`      | `https://api.eu.axiom.co` |

Each instance was entirely independent with separate:
- Organizations and user accounts
- Billing and subscription plans
- API endpoints and ingestion URLs
- Data storage and query infrastructure

### Migration from legacy EU instance

The unified multi-region model is rolling out progressively. If your organization currently uses the legacy EU instance, Axiom will contact you about the opportunity to migrate to the unified platform.

<Note>
All examples in the Axiom API reference use the base domain `https://api.axiom.co`, which is the default for the legacy US instance. If your organization uses the legacy EU instance, use the base domain `https://api.eu.axiom.co` until Axiom migrates your organization to the unified platform.
