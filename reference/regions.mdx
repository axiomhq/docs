Axiom is available in multiple regions to help you comply with data residency requirements and optimize performance.

## Towards a unified multi-region platform

Axiom is rolling out support for a unified platform where a single organization can manage datasets across multiple regions. This will give you complete control to decide where your data is stored and processed, along with the following benefits:

- **One organization, multiple regions**: Create and manage datasets in different geographic regions from a single account.
- **Unified billing**: Single subscription covering all your regions.
- **Cross-region visibility**: View and manage all your data from one console.
- **Flexible data residency**: Place each dataset in the region that best meets your compliance and performance requirements.
- **Compliance**: Support GDPR and other regional data protection requirements.

### Current capabilities

- You choose the default region when you create a new organization.
- You can choose from two available regions: US and EU.
- You can’t change the default region after creating the organization.
- Axiom stores the data you ingest in the default region of your organization.
- When you run a query, the execution happens in the US region only. This means that when you query data that’s stored the EU region, the data leaves the region.

### Roadmap

Axoim is working on the following:

- Support additional regions.
- Store data outside your default region. When you create a new dataset, you’ll be able to will choose the region where Axiom stores its data.
- Execute queries in the same region where the data is stored.

Your view can help shape this roadmap. [Contact Axiom](https://www.axiom.co/contact) if you need a region that’s not currently supported or if you have any other suggestions.

## Available regions

Axiom currently supports the following cloud regions for data ingest:

<BaseDomains />

<Note>
The base domain of all other API endpoints is `https://api.axiom.co`.

## Determine default region

The default region of your organization determines where Axiom stores your data.

To determine your organization’s default region:

1. Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > General**.
1. Find your organization’s default region in the **Region** section.

## Choose region

When you create a new organization, choose the region that best meets your data residency requirements and where your infrastructure is located for optimal performance.

When choosing a region, consider the following factors:

- **Data residency requirements**: If you need to comply with regulations like GDPR that require data to be stored in specific regions, choose the appropriate region.
- **Performance**: Choose the region closest to your infrastructure for lower latency.
- **Team location**: Choose the region that your team is primarily located in for better performance.

## Legacy infrastructure

Until November 2025, Axiom operated separate infrastructures for two dedicated regional instances:

| Instance   | Base domain of Axiom Console   | Base domain of API endpoints         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| US         | `https://app.axiom.co`         | `https://api.axiom.co` |
| EU         | `https://app.eu.axiom.co`      | `https://api.eu.axiom.co` |

Each instance was entirely independent with separate:
- Organizations and user accounts
- Billing and subscription plans
- API endpoints and ingestion URLs
- Data storage and query infrastructure

### Migration from legacy EU instance

The unified multi-region model is rolling out progressively. If your organization currently uses the legacy EU instance, Axiom will contact you about the opportunity to migrate to the unified platform.

<Note>
All examples in the Axiom API reference use the base domain `https://api.axiom.co`, which is the default for the legacy US instance. If your organization uses the legacy EU instance, use the base domain `https://api.eu.axiom.co` until Axiom migrates your organization to the unified platform.
