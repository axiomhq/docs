Axiom is available in multiple regions to help you comply with data residency requirements and optimize performance. When you create an Axiom organization, you choose the region where your data is stored and processed.

## Available regions

Axiom currently supports the following regions:

| Region | Location | App URL | API URL |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|
| **US** | United States (most common) | `https://app.axiom.co` | `https://api.axiom.co` |
| **EU** | European Union | `https://app.eu.axiom.co` | `https://api.eu.axiom.co` |

<Info>
Axiom will support a unified multi-region model by early November 2025. This will allow you to manage data across different regions from a single organization. [Contact Axiom](https://www.axiom.co/contact) to learn more.

## Choose your region

Your organization's region is set when you create the organization and cannot be changed later. Choose the region that best meets your data residency requirements and where your infrastructure is located for optimal performance.

When you sign up for Axiom, consider the following factors:

- **Data residency requirements**: If you need to comply with regulations like GDPR that require data to be stored in specific regions, choose the appropriate region.
- **Performance**: Choose the region closest to your infrastructure for lower latency.
- **Team location**: If your team is primarily in Europe, the EU region may provide better performance.

The examples in this documentation use the US domain. If your organization uses the EU region, update the base domain in the examples to match your region.

## Check your region

Determine the region your organization uses in one of the following ways:

- Go to the [Axiom app](https://app.axiom.co/) and check the URL. Match the base domain in the Axiom web app with the table below:

    | Region     | Base domain in web app         |
    | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
    | US         | `https://app.axiom.co`         |

- Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > General**, and then find the **Region** section.

## Axiom API reference

All examples in the documentation use the default US base domain `https://api.axiom.co`.

| Region     | Base domain of API endpoints         | Example                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| US         | `https://api.axiom.co`               | `https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/DATASET_NAME/ingest`    |

## Switch or add regions

<Warning>
You cannot change your organization's region after creation. If you need to use a different region, you must create a new organization in that region and migrate your data.
</Warning>

Enterprise customers can access additional regions or set up multi-region deployments. For more information, [contact Axiom](https://www.axiom.co/contact) to discuss your requirements.
