Axiom is available in multiple regions to help you comply with data residency requirements and optimize performance.

## Available regions

Axiom currently supports the following cloud regions for data ingest:

| Region     | Base domain of edge ingest API endpoints         | Example                                           | Cloud provider |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| US         | `https://us-east-1.aws.edge.axiom.co` | `https://us-east-1.aws.edge.axiom.co/v1/ingest/DATASET_NAME`    | AWS |
| EU         | `https://eu-central-1.aws.edge.axiom.co` | `https://eu-central-1.aws.edge.axiom.co/v1/ingest/DATASET_NAME` | AWS |

The base domain of other API endpoints is `https://api.axiom.co`.

<Info>
Axiom is developing support for additional regions. [Contact Axiom](https://www.axiom.co/contact) if you need a region that’s not currently supported.

<Info>
Query execution currently happens in the US region only. This means that data in the EU region can leave the region when queried. As we continue to build out support for multiple regions, we will update query behavior to ensure that query execution happens in the same region as the storage region of the data being queried.

## Default region

The default region of your organization determines where the data in your datasets are stored.

To determine your organization’s default region:

1. Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > General**.
1. Find your organization’s default region in the **Region** section.

<Info>
Axiom is building support for storing data outside your default region on a dataset-by-dataset basis.

## Choose region

When you create a new organization, choose the region that best meets your data residency requirements and where your infrastructure is located for optimal performance.

When choosing a region, consider the following factors:

- **Data residency requirements**: If you need to comply with regulations like GDPR that require data to be stored in specific regions, choose the appropriate region.
- **Performance**: Choose the region closest to your infrastructure for lower latency.
- **Team location**: Choose the region that your team is primarily located in for better performance.

## Roadmap

### Legacy infrastructure: Dedicated regional instances

Until November 2025, Axiom operated completely separate infrastructures for different regions:

- **US instance**: `app.axiom.co` hosted in AWS `us-east-1`
- **EU instance**: `app.eu.axiom.co` hosted in AWS `eu-central-1`

Each instance was entirely independent with separate:
- Organizations and user accounts
- Billing and subscription plans
- API endpoints and ingestion URLs
- Data storage and query infrastructure

### Towards a unified multi-region platform

Starting in November 2025, Axiom is rolling out support for a unified platform where a single organization can manage datasets across multiple regions:

- **One organization, multiple regions**: Create and manage datasets in different geographic regions from a single account.
- **Unified billing**: Single subscription covering all your regions.
- **Cross-region visibility**: View and manage all your data from one console.
- **Flexible data residency**: Place each dataset in the region that best meets your compliance and performance requirements.

### Migration from legacy EU instance

The unified multi-region model is rolling out progressively. If your organization currently uses the legacy EU instance, Axiom will contact you about the opportunity to migrate to the unified platform.
