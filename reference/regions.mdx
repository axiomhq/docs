<Info>
Axiom will soon support a unified multi-region model to manage data across the US, EU (and beyond) from a single organization. [Contact Axiom](https://www.axiom.co/contact) to learn more.
</Info>

In Axiom, your organization can use one of the following regions:
- US (most common)
- EU

The examples in this documentation use the US domain. If your organization uses the EU region, the base domain of the Axiom app and the Axiom API reference is different from the US region and you need to make some changes to the examples you find in this documentation.

## Check your region

Determine the region your organization uses in one of the following ways:

- Go to the [Axiom app](https://app.axiom.co/) and check the URL. Match the base domain in the Axiom web app with the table below:

    | Region     | Base domain in web app         |
    | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
    | US         | `https://app.axiom.co`         |
    | EU         | `https://app.eu.axiom.co`      |

- Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > General**, and then find the **Region** section.

## Axiom API reference

All examples in the documentation use the default US base domain `https://api.axiom.co`.

If your organization uses the EU region, change the base domain in the examples to `https://api.eu.axiom.co`.

| Region     | Base domain of API endpoints         | Example                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| US         | `https://api.axiom.co`               | `https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/DATASET_NAME/ingest`    |
| EU         | `https://api.eu.axiom.co`            | `https://api.eu.axiom.co/v1/datasets/DATASET_NAME/ingest` |
