description: 'This page explains how to work with Axiom based on your organizationâ€™s region.'
---

In Axiom, your organization can use one of the following regions:
- US (most common)
- EU

The examples in this documentation use the US domain. If your organization uses the EU region, the base domain of the Axiom app and the Axiom API reference is different from the US region and you need to make some changes to the examples you find in this documentation.

## Check your region

To check which region your organization uses, open the Axiom web app and check the URL in the browser:
- If the URL starts with `https://app.axiom.co/`, you use the default US region.
- If the URL starts with `https://app.eu.axiom.co/`, you use the EU region.

## Axiom app

If your organization uses the US region, the base domain is `https://app.axiom.co/`.

If your organization uses the EU region, the base domain is `https://app.eu.axiom.co/`. This is different from the default US region `https://app.axiom.co/` you see everywhere in the documentation.

## Axiom API reference

All examples in the [Axiom API reference](/restapi/introduction) use the default US base domain `https://api.axiom.co`. For example, if your organization uses the US region, send data to Axiom with the URL `https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/{id}/ingest`.

If your organization uses the EU region, change the base domain in the examples to `https://api.eu.axiom.co`. For example, if your organization uses the EU region, send data to Axiom with the URL `https://api.eu.axiom.co/v1/datasets/{id}/ingest`.
