Axiom is a unified data platform built on edge deployments.

When you create an organization, you choose a primary edge deployment like `US East 1 (AWS)`, and your event data is stored at rest in that infrastructure. You manage everything through Axiom’s Console at `app.axiom.co` regardless of which edge deployment you select.

This edge deployment model provides flexibility that isn’t possible with separate regional instances. With regional add-ons, you can create datasets in different edge deployments while maintaining unified management and billing.

## Available edge deployments

Axiom currently supports the following edge deployments:

<BaseDomains />

<Note>
The base domain of all other API endpoints is `api.axiom.co`.

Axiom prioritizes new edge deployments based on interest. [Contact Axiom](https://www.axiom.co/contact) to discuss your requirements.

## Current capabilities

Your organization’s default edge deployment determines where Axiom stores event data at rest and where queries execute. When you run a query, both the execution and results remain within your selected edge deployment.

See the table below for current behavior:

| Operation | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data ingest** | Selected edge deployment |
| **Data storage** | Selected edge deployment |
| **Query execution** | Selected edge deployment |
| **Query results** | Selected edge deployment |
| **Account data** | US infrastructure |

When you select an edge deployment, event data is ingested, stored, and queried entirely within that edge deployment. Query results are returned directly from your regional edge without routing through other infrastructure. Account management operations (user settings, billing, organization configuration) are processed through Axiom’s centralized US infrastructure.

### Compliance considerations

Axiom’s edge deployment architecture supports data-sovereignty requirements by keeping event data ingestion, storage, query execution, and query results within your selected edge deployment. This architecture is designed to meet frameworks that require both storage and processing of data to take place entirely within a designated region.

Account management operations (user authentication, billing, organization settings) are processed through Axiom’s centralized US infrastructure. Evaluate whether this meets your specific compliance requirements. For most data-sovereignty frameworks, the critical factor is where event data is stored and processed, which remains entirely within your selected edge deployment.

### Determine your organization’s edge deployment

The default edge deployment of your organization determines where Axiom stores your event data unless you specify a different edge deployment when creating a dataset. You can’t change your default edge deployment after creating your organization.

To determine your organization’s default edge deployment:

1. Click <Icon icon="gear" iconType="solid"/> **Settings > General**.
1. Find your organization’s default edge deployment in the **Edge deployment** section.

## Multi-region organizations

To create datasets in an edge deployment other than your organization’s default edge deployment, purchase the add-on associated with the desired edge deployment. You will then be able to choose the edge deployment associated with a dataset on dataset creation. Note that the add-on must remain active to retain access to datasets located outside your organization’s default edge deployment.

Queries run in a multi-region organization can only access data from a single edge deployment at a time. When wildcard operators are used to match datasets in queries run in multi-region organizations, only datasets within the organization’s default edge deployment will be matched.

## SDKs and edge deployments

Axiom SDKs will support edge deployments through environment variables. The SDKs will default to `US East 1 (AWS)`. Until Axiom updates all SDKs, configure ingest endpoints manually.

## Legacy EU instance

Axiom had previously operated two completely separate infrastructures to support an EU region:

| Instance | Console base domain | API endpoint base domain | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| US | `app.axiom.co` | `api.axiom.co` | 
| EU | `app.eu.axiom.co` | `api.eu.axiom.co` | 

These instances had independent user accounts, billing systems, and API endpoints. In time, this EU instance will be retired in favor of flexible edge deployments.

### Migration to edge deployments

If your organization currently uses the legacy EU instance, Axiom will contact you directly about migration. The migration will move your data to the new unified model, keeping your data intact.

Until migration, continue using your current EU instance endpoints. All API examples in Axiom’s documentation use the `api.axiom.co` base domain by default. If you’re on the legacy EU instance, replace this with the `api.eu.axiom.co` base domain in all API calls.
