Axiom is a unified data platform built on regional edge deployments.

When you create an organization, you choose a primary edge deployment like `US East 1 (AWS)`, and your event data is stored at rest in that infrastructure. You manage everything through Axiom’s Console at `app.axiom.co` regardless of which edge deployment you select.

This edge deployment model provides flexibility that isn’t possible with separate regional instances. As Axiom introduces additional edge deployments, you’ll be able to write event data to specific locations with ease while maintaining unified management and billing.

## Available edge deployments

Axiom currently supports the following edge deployments for data ingest:

<BaseDomains />

<Note>
All other API operations use `https://api.axiom.co` as the base domain.
</Note>

New edge deployments are prioritized based on interest. [Contact us](https://www.axiom.co/contact) to discuss your requirements.

## Current capabilities

Your organization’s default edge deployment determines where event data is stored at rest. Query execution and account operations currently route through centralized infrastructure, which will change as edge deployment capabilities expand.

| Operation | Current behavior | Evolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data ingest** | Your selected edge deployment | - |
| **Data storage** | Your selected edge deployment | - |
| **Query execution** | Your selected edge deployment | - |
| **Query results** | US infrastructure | Planned to move to regional edge deployment  |
| **Account data** | US infrastructure | - |

**Non-US edge deployments:** Event data is ingested and stored in your chosen edge deployment. When you run a query through Axiom’s Console, API, or monitors, that query will currently execute in US infrastructure. Your event data remains stored in your chosen edge deployment, but query processing involves cross-edge access to that data.

### Compliance considerations

Some data-sovereignty frameworks may accommodate this architecture when supported by appropriate transfer mechanisms (for example, SCCs).

Strict public-sector or regulated-industry frameworks might not permit cross-border processing. This is typically because these frameworks require that both storage and processing of personal data take place entirely within the designated edge. Evaluate based on your specific requirements. If your compliance obligations prohibit query results from crossing regional boundaries, wait for within-edge query execution.

### Check your organization’s edge deployment

To see which edge deployment your organization uses:

1. In the Axiom console, go to **Settings > General**
2. Look for the **Edge deployment** field

You can’t currently change your edge deployment after creating your organization.

## What’s coming

Axiom is evolving its edge deployment architecture to provide more flexibility and control.

#### Integration support

<Badge>Jan 2026</Badge> [Integrations](/apps/introduction) like Vercel, Netlify, and Cloudflare Logpush will include edge deployment selection in their setup flows, automatically routing ingest to the correct edge endpoint based on your dataset configuration. Until then, choose `US East 1 (AWS)` to access these integrations.

#### Within-edge query execution

<Badge>Jan 2026</Badge> Query processing will move to regional edge deployments. For example, when you query data stored in an EU edge deployment, the entire operation, from query execution to results, will happen within EU infrastructure.

### Multi-region organization

<Badge>Q1 2026</Badge> You’ll be able to manage datasets across multiple edge deployments within a single organization. After selecting a default edge deployment, you can activate additional edge deployments and configure individual datasets to store data in any active edge deployment. This enables global operations without managing multiple Axiom organizations.

## SDKs and edge deployments

Axiom SDKs will support edge deployments through environment variables. These SDKs will default to `US East 1 (AWS)`. Until SDK updates are made, please manually configure ingest endpoints.

## Legacy EU instance

Axiom had previously operated two completely separate infrastructures to support an EU region:

| Instance | Console | API endpoint | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| US | `https://app.axiom.co` | `https://api.axiom.co` | 
| EU | `https://app.eu.axiom.co` | `https://api.eu.axiom.co` | 

These instances had independent user accounts, billing systems, and API endpoints. In time, this EU instance will be retired in favor of flexible edge deployments.

### Migration to edge deployments

If your organization currently uses `app.eu.axiom.co`, Axiom will contact you directly about migration once within-region query execution becomes available. The migration will move your data to the new unified model while preserving your dataset contents.

Until migration, continue using your current EU instance endpoints. All API examples in Axiom’s documentation use `api.axiom.co` by default. If you're on the legacy EU instance, substitute `api.eu.axiom.co` in all API calls.
