## Access

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enables organizations to manage and restrict access to their data and resources efficiently. You can find and configure RBAC settings in the Access section located within the settings page in Axiom.

The Access section consists of the following components:

- API tokens
- Groups
- Roles
- Users

Each of these components plays an important role in defining access to Axiom.

### API tokens

You can use the Axiom API and CLI to programmatically ingest data and manage your organisation settings. For example, you can add new notifiers and change existing monitors with API requests. To prove that these requests come from you, you must include forms of authentication called tokens in your API requests. One form of authentication is an API token. API tokens let you control the actions that can be performed with the token. For example, you can specify that requests authenticated with a certain API token can only query data from a particular dataset. For more information, see [Tokens](/reference/tokens).

### Groups 

Groups connect users with roles, making it easier to manage access control at scale.

Organizations might create groups for areas of their business like Security, Infrastructure, or Business Analytics, with specific roles assigned to serve the unique needs of these domains.

Since groups connect users with one or many roles, users' complete set of capabilities are derived from the additive union of their base role, plus any roles assigned through group membership.

To create a new group:

1. Navigate to Groups and select New group.
1. Enter the name and description of the group.
1. Add users to the group. Clicking on Add users will display a list of available users.
1. Add roles to the group by clicking Add roles, which will present a list of available roles.

### Roles

Roles are sets of capabilities that define which actions a user can perform at both the organization and dataset levels.

<Note>
Role-based access control (RBAC) is available as an add-on if you’re on the Axiom Cloud plan, and it’s included by default on the Bring Your Own Cloud plan.
</Note>

#### Default roles

Axiom provides a set of default roles for all organizations:

- Owner: Assigns all capabilities across the entire Axiom platform.
- Admin: Assigns administrative capabilities but not Billing capabilities, which are reserved for Owners.
- User: Assigns standard access for regular users.
- Read-only: Assigns read capabilities for datasets, plus read access on various resources like dashboards, monitors, notifiers, users, queries, saved queries, and virtual fields.
- None: Assigns zero capabilities, useful for adopting the principle of least privilege when inviting new users. Users with this default role can have specific capabilities built up through Roles assigned to a Group.

#### Create custom role

Users must have the create permission for the access control capability assigned in order to create custom roles, which is enabled for the default Owner and Admin roles.

1. Navigate to Roles and select New role.
1. Enter the name and description of the role.
1. Assign capabilities: Roles can be assigned various permissions (create, read, update, and delete) across capabilities like Access control, API tokens, dashboards, and datasets.

#### Assign capabilities to roles 

Role creation is split into organization-level and dataset-level capabilities. Each capability has options to assign create, read, update, or delete (CRUD) permissions.

Organization-level capabilities define access for various parts of an Axiom organization.

- **Access control**: Full CRUD.
- **API tokens**: Full CRUD.
- **Apps**: Full CRUD.
- **Billing**: Read and update only.
- **Dashboards**: Full CRUD.
- **Datasets**: Full CRUD.
- **Endpoints**: Full CRUD.
- **Monitors**: Full CRUD.
- **Notifiers**: Full CRUD.
- **Shared Access Key**: Read and update only.
- **Users**: Full CRUD.

### Users

Users in Axiom are the individual accounts that have access to an organization. Users are assigned a base role when joining an organization which is configured during the invite step. For organizations with the role-based access control (RBAC) add-on, additional roles can be added through group membership.

To manage users:

1. Navigate to Settings and select Users.
1. Review and manage the list of users and assign default or custom base roles as desired.

Access for a user is the additive union of capabilities assigned through their default role, plus any capabilities included in roles assigned through group membership.

### Directory Sync

Directory Sync automatically mirrors user account data between a central directory, such as Active Directory, and connected applications. When the status of an employee changes, all systems are automatically updated.

For this feature, Axiom relies on WorkOS. For more information, see [Directory Sync](https://workos.com/directory-sync) and [Enterprise Single Sign-On](https://workos.com/single-sign-on) in the WorkOS documentation.

<Note>
Directory Sync is available as an add-on if you’re on the Axiom Cloud plan, and it’s included by default on the Bring Your Own Cloud plan.
</Note>

## Data

### Apps

Enrich your Axiom organization with a catalog of migrations tools, and dedicated apps, and gain complete visibility into any platform, and get alerts on your errors to stay ahead of issues.

By properly monitoring your apps with Axiom, you can spot slowdowns, hiccups, bad requests, errored requests, and function cache performance and know which actions to take to correct these issues before there are user-facing consequences.

[Check out supported apps](/apps/introduction)

### Datasets

Manage datasets for your organization, including creating new datasets or deleting existing datasets.


### Endpoints

Endpoints allow you to easily integrate Axiom into your existing data flow using tools and libraries that you already know. With Endpoints, you can build and configure your existing tooling to send data to Axiom so you can start monitoring your logs immediately.
