Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows you to manage and restrict access to your data and resources efficiently. You can control access to your data with the following:

- [Groups](#groups)
- [Roles](#roles)
- [Users](#users)
- [Directory Sync](#directory-sync)

<Note>
Role-based access control (RBAC) and Directory Sync are available as add-ons if you’re on the Axiom Cloud plan, and they are included by default on the Bring Your Own Cloud plan.
</Note>

## Groups

Groups connect users with roles, making it easier to manage access control at scale. For example, you can create groups for areas of your business like Security, Infrastructure, or Business Analytics, with specific roles assigned to serve the unique needs of these domains.

A user’s complete set of capabilities is derived from the additive union of their base role, plus any roles assigned through group membership.

### Create new group

1. Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Groups**
1. Click **New group**.
1. Enter the name and description of the group.
1. Click **Add users** to add users to the group.
1. Click **Add roles** to add roles to the group.

## Roles

Roles are sets of capabilities that define which actions a user can perform at both the organization and dataset levels.

### Default roles

The default roles are the following:

- **Owner:** Assigns all capabilities across the entire Axiom platform.
- **Admin:** Assigns administrative capabilities except for Billing capabilities, which are reserved for Owners.
- **User:** Assigns standard access for regular users.
- **Read-only:** Assigns read capabilities for datasets, plus read access on various resources like dashboards, monitors, notifiers, users, queries, saved queries, and virtual fields.
- **None:** Assigns zero capabilities, useful for adopting the principle of least privilege when inviting new users. You can build up specific capabilities for these users by assigning their role to a group.

### Create custom role

1. Ensure you have create permission for the access control capability. By default, this capability is assigned to the Owner and Admin roles.
1. Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Roles**.
1. Click **New role**.
1. Enter the name and description of the role.
1. Assign permissions (create, read, update, and delete) across capabilities (access control, API tokens, dashboards, datasets, etc.).

### Assign capabilities to roles

You can assign organization-level and dataset-level capabilities to roles. You can assign create, read, update, or delete (CRUD) permissions to most capabilities.

Organization-level capabilities define access for various parts of your Axiom organization:

- **Access control:** Full CRUD.
- **Annotations:** Full CRUD.
- **API tokens:** Full CRUD.
- **Apps:** Full CRUD.
- **Audit log:** Read only.
- **Billing:** Read and update only.
- **Dashboards:** Full CRUD.
- **Datasets:** Full CRUD.
- **Endpoints:** Full CRUD.
- **Flows:** Full CRUD.
- **Monitors:** Full CRUD.
- **Notifiers:** Full CRUD.
- **Shared access keys:** Read and update only.
- **Users:** Full CRUD.
- **Views:** Full CRUD.

The table below describes these organization-level capabilities:

## Users

Users in Axiom are the individual accounts that have access to an Axiom organization. You assign a base role to users when you invite them to join your organization. For organizations with the role-based access control (RBAC) add-on, additional roles can be added through group membership.

### Assign roles to users

1. Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Users**.
1. Find the user in the list, and then assign a role to them on the right.

Access for a user is the additive union of capabilities assigned through their default role, plus any capabilities included in roles assigned through group membership.

### Delete users

<Warning>
This is a destructive action. After you delete a user, you cannot recover their account.
</Warning>

1. Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Users**.
1. Find the user in the list, and then click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/delete.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Delete user icon" /> **Delete user** on the right.

## Directory Sync

Directory Sync automatically mirrors user account data between a central directory, such as Active Directory, and connected applications. When the status of an employee changes, all systems are automatically updated.

For this feature, Axiom relies on WorkOS. For more information, see [Directory Sync](https://workos.com/directory-sync) and [Enterprise Single Sign-On](https://workos.com/single-sign-on) in the WorkOS documentation.
