This section walks you through the most essential Axiom settings.

## Access Overview

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enables organizations to manage and restrict access to their data and resources efficiently. You can find and configure RBAC settings in the Access section located within the settings page in Axiom.

The Access section consists of the following components:

- API tokens
- Groups
- Roles
- Users

Each of these components plays an important role in defining access to Axiom.

### Getting Your API Key

To get your API key in Axiom:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Access** > **API Tokens** in your Axiom dashboard.
2. Click the **New Token** button.
3. Configure your token:
   - Enter a descriptive name for your token
   - Set an expiration date (optional)
   - Select the datasets this token should have access to
   - Choose the appropriate permissions:
     - **Ingest**: Allows sending data to datasets
     - **Query**: Allows reading data from datasets
     - **Management**: Enables creating/updating/deleting resources

4. Click **Create Token** to generate your API key.
5. Copy and securely store your token immediately - you won't be able to see it again after leaving the page.

<Note>
  API tokens are different from Personal Access Tokens (PATs). API tokens are for specific dataset and operation access, while PATs provide full account access. Choose the appropriate token type based on your needs.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Never share your API tokens or commit them to version control. Treat them like passwords and keep them secure.
</Warning>

### API tokens

You can use the Axiom API and CLI to programmatically ingest data and manage your organisation settings. For example, you can add new notifiers and change existing monitors with API requests. To prove that these requests come from you, you must include forms of authentication called tokens in your API requests. One form of authentication is an API token. API tokens let you control the actions that can be performed with the token. For example, you can specify that requests authenticated with a certain API token can only query data from a particular dataset. For more information, see [Tokens](/reference/tokens).

### Roles

Roles are sets of capabilities that define which actions a user can perform at both the organization and dataset levels.
