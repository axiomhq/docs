If your organization uses the EU domain, the base domain of the Axiom app and the Axiom API reference differs from the US domain.

The examples in this documentation use the US domain. If your organization uses the EU domain, you need to adjust the examples you find in this documentation.

## Check your domain

To check which domain your organization uses, open the Axiom web app and check the URL in the browser:
- If the URL starts with `https://app.axiom.co/`, you use the default US domain.
- If the URL starts with `https://app.eu.axiom.co/`, you use the EU domain.

## Axiom app

If your organization uses the EU domain, the base domain is `https://app.eu.axiom.co/`. This differs from the default US domain `https://app.axiom.co/` shown throughout the documentation.

## Axiom API reference

All examples in the [Axiom API reference](/restapi/introduction) use the US domain `api.axiom.co`.

If your organization uses the EU domain, change the base domain in the examples to `api.eu.axiom.co`.
