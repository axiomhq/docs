If your organization uses the EU domain, the base domain of the Axiom app and the Axiom API reference is different from the US domain.

The examples in this documentation use the US domain. For this reason, if your organization use the EU domain, you need to make some changes to the examples you find in this documentation.

## Check your domain

To check which domain your organization uses, open the Axiom web app and check the URL in the browser:
- If the URL starts with `https://app.axiom.co/`, you use the default US domain.
- If the URL starts with `https://app.eu.axiom.co/`, you use the EU domain.

## Axiom app

If your organization uses the EU domain, the base domain is `https://app.eu.axiom.co/`. This is different from the default US domain `https://app.axiom.co/` you see everywhere in the documentation.

## Axiom API reference

All examples in the [Axiom API reference](/restapi/introduction) use the US domain `https://api.axiom.co`. For example, if your organization uses the US domain, send data to Axiom with the URL `https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/DATASET_NAME/ingest`.

If your organization uses the EU domain, change the base domain in the examples to `https://api.eu.axiom.co`. For example, if your organization uses the EU domain, send data to Axiom with the URL `https://api.eu.axiom.co/v1/datasets/DATASET_NAME/ingest`.
