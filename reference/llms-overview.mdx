## Interpret the full docs

To make it easy for LLMs to interpret the documentation, Axiom offers the following based on the [/llms.txt standard](https://llmstxt.org/):

- [List of docs pages](https://axiom.co/docs/llms.txt)
- [Full documentation](https://axiom.co/docs/llms-full.txt) 

Access one of the above documents and pass it to your LLM to start interpreting the Axiom documentation.
