This reference article explains how to share datasets in Axiom, including creating sharing links, viewing sharing status, and removing access to shared datasets.

## How sharing works

##Â How sharing works
>>>>>>> main

Dataset sharing allows you to grant query access to your datasets to other Axiom organizations. In addition to directly querying the dataset, the receiving organization can also create other Axiom resources that rely on query access, such as dashboards and monitors. The receiving organization has no ability to ingest data to or otherwise modify the shared dataset, and no ingest charges accrue to the receiving organization. All query usage associated with a shared dataset accrues to the organization running the query. 

## Share a dataset

To share a dataset, follow these steps:

1. Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Datasets**.
1. Click on the sharing icon for the dataset you wish to share.
1. Click the button to create a new sharing link. Share the resulting URL with an individual in the organization you wish to share the dataset with. On visiting the URL, the receiving user will be shown the email address associated with your Axiom account, and asked to confirm that they wish to receive the shared dataset.

Note that by default, only those with the 'Owner' role in an organization can share a dataset. 

## Receiving a shared dataset

If another Axiom user wishes to share a dataset with you, you can accept the dataset into your chosen organization by following these steps:

1. Enter the URL provided by the user into your address bar. A valid sharing URL looks like https://app.axiom.co/s/dataset/{sharing-token}
1. Review the details shown about the dataset and the organization that you're choosing to receive the dataset. Click **Add dataset** if satisfied.

## Deleting a sharing URL

A sharing URL remains active until deleted. To delete a sharing link, follow these steps:

1. Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Datasets**.
1. Click on the sharing icon for the dataset whose sharing URL you wish to delete.
1. Click the button to delete the sharing URL.

Note that deleting a sharing URL will not impact any existing shared access to the dataset.

## Removing access to a shared dataset

The owner of a dataset can remove access to the dataset at any time. To remove access for a given organization, follow these steps:

1. Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Datasets**.
1. Click on the sharing icon for the dataset whose access you wish to modify.
1. Identify the name of the organization whose access you want to remove from the list of organizations with access, and click the button to remove access.

## Removing a shared dataset

If your organization has had a dataset shared with you, users with Delete permissions for that dataset can remove the dataset. Note that this does not delete the underlying dataset. To remove a shared dataset, follow these steps:

1. Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Datasets**.
1. Click on the delete icon for the shared dataset you wish to remove.
