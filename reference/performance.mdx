## Mixing unrelated data in datasets

### Problem

A “kitchen-sink” dataset is one in which events from multiple, unrelated applications or services get lumped together, often resulting in:

- **Excessive width (too many columns)**: Adding more and more unique fields bloats the schema, reducing query throughput.
- **Mixed data types in the same field**: For example, some events store `user_id` as a string, while others store it as a number in the same `user_id` field.
- **Unrelated schemas in a single dataset**: Columns that make sense for one app might be `null` or typed differently for another.

These issues reduce compression efficiency and force Axiom to scan more data than necessary.

### Why it matters

- **Slower queries**: Each query must scan wider blocks of data and handle inconsistent column types.
- **Higher resource usage**: Wide schemas reduce row packing in blocks, harming throughput and potentially raising costs.
- **Harder data exploration**: When fields differ drastically between events, discovering the correct columns or shaping queries becomes more difficult.

### How to fix it

- **Keep datasets narrowly focused:** Group data from the same application or service in its own dataset. For example, keep `k8s_logs` separate from `web_traffic`.
- **Avoid mixing data types for the same field:** Enforce consistent types during ingest. If a field is numeric, always send numeric values.
- **Consider using map fields:** If you have sparse or high-cardinality nested data, consider storing it in a single map (object) field instead of flattening every key. This reduces the total number of top-level fields. Axiom’s [map fields](/apl/data-types/map-fields#map-fields) are optimized for large objects.

## Excessive backfilling and large `_time` vs. `_sysTime` gaps

### Problem

Axiom’s `_time` index is critical for query performance. Ideally, incoming events for a block lie in a closely bounded time range. However, backfilling large amounts of historical data after the fact (especially out of chronological order) creates wide time overlaps in blocks. If `_time` is far from `_sysTime` (the time the event was ingested), Axiom’s time index effectiveness is weakened.

### Why it matters

- **Poor performance on time-based queries**: Blocks must be scanned despite time filters, because many blocks overlap the query time window.
- **Inefficient block filtering**: Queries that filter on time must scan blocks that contain data from a wide time range.
- **Large data merges**: Compaction processes that rely on time ordering become less efficient.

### How to fix it

- **Minimize backfill:** Try to ingest events close to their actual creation time whenever possible. Ingest events close to the time they occur.
- **Backfill in dedicated batches:** If you must backfill older data, do it in dedicated batches that do not mix with live data.
- **Use discrete backfill intervals:** When backfilling data, ingest one segment at a time (for example, day-by-day).
- **Avoid wide time ranges in a single batch:** If you are sending data for a 24-hour period, avoid mixing in data that is weeks or months older.
- **Be aware of ingestion concurrency:** Avoid mixing brand-new events with extremely old events in the same ingest request.

<Note>
Future improvements: Axiom’s roadmap includes an initiative which aims to mitigate the impact of poorly clustered time data by performing incremental time-based compaction. Until then, avoid mixing large historical ranges with live ingest whenever possible.

## Large number of fields in a dataset

### Problem

Slow query performance in datasets with very high dimensionality (with more than several thousand fields).

### Why it matters

Axiom stores event data in a tuned format. As a result:
- The number of distinct values (cardinality) in your data impacts performance because low-cardinality fields compress better than high-cardinality fields.
- The number of fields in a dataset (dimensionality) impacts performance.
- The volume of data collected impacts performance.

### How to fix it

Scoping the number of fields in a dataset below a few thousand can help you achieve the best performance in Axiom.

## Failing to use the `_time` field for event timestamps

### Problem

Axiom’s core optimizations rely on `_time` for indexing and time-based queries. If you store event timestamps in a different field (for example, `timestamp` or `created_at`) and use that field in time filters, Axiom’s time-based optimizations will not be leveraged.

### Why it matters

- **No time-based indexing**: Every block must be scanned because your custom timestamp field is invisible to the time index.

### How to fix it

- **Always use `_time`:** Configure your ingest pipelines so that Axiom sets `_time` to the actual event timestamp.
    - If you have a custom field like `created_at`, rename it to `_time` at ingest.
    - Verify that your ingestion library or agent is correctly populating `_time`.
- **Use Axiom’s native time filters:** Rely on `where _time >= ... and _time <= ...` or the built-in time range selectors in the query UI.

## Handling mixed types in the same field

### Problem

A single field sometimes stores different data types across events (for instance, strings in some events and integers in others). This is typically a side effect of using “kitchen-sink” ingestion or inconsistent parsing logic in your code.

### Why it matters

- **Reduced compression**: Storing multiple types in the same column (variant column) is less efficient than storing a single type.
- **Complex queries**: You might need frequent casting or conditional logic in queries (`tostring()` calls, etc.).

### How to fix it

- **Standardize your types at ingest:** If a field is semantically an integer, always send it as an integer.
- **Use consistent schemas across services:** If multiple applications write to the same dataset, agree on a schema and data types.
- **Perform corrections at the source:** If you discover your data has been mixed historically, stop ingesting mismatched types. Over time, new blocks will reflect the corrected types even though historical blocks remain mixed.

## Overly wide queries returning more fields than needed

### Problem

By default, Axiom’s query engine projects all fields (`project *`) for each matching event. This can return large amounts of unneeded data, especially in wide datasets with many fields.

### Why it matters

- **High I/O and memory usage**: Unnecessary data is scanned, read, and returned.
- **Slower queries**: Time is wasted processing fields you never use.

### How to fix it

- **Use `project` or `project-keep`**
    
    Specify exactly which fields you need. For example:
    
    ```kusto
    dataset
    | where status == 500
    | project timestamp, error_code, user_id
    ```
    
- **Use `project-away` if you only need to exclude a few fields:** If you need 90% of the fields but want to exclude the largest ones, for instance:
    
    ```kusto
    dataset
    | project-away debug_payload, large_object_field
    
    ```
    
- **Limit your results**
    
    If you only need a sample of events for debugging, use a lower `limit` value (such as 10) instead of the default 1000.
    

## Regular expressions when simple filters suffice

### Problem

Regular expressions (`matches`, `regex`) can be powerful, but they are also expensive to evaluate, especially on large datasets.

### Why it matters

- **High CPU usage**: Regex filters require complex per-row matching.
- **Slower queries**: Large swaths of data are scanned with less efficient matching.

### How to fix it

- **Use direct string filters**
    
    Instead of:
    
    ```kusto
    dataset
    | where message matches "[Ff]ailed"
    ```

    Use:
    
    ```kusto
    dataset
    | where message contains "failed"
    ```
    
- **Use `search` for substring search:**
    
    To find `foobar` in all fields, use:
    
    ```kusto
    dataset
    | search "foobar"
    ```
    
    `search` matches text in all fields. To find text in a specific field, a more efficient solution is to use the following:
    
    ```kusto
    dataset
    | where FIELD contains_cs "foobar"
    ```
    
    In this example, `cs` stands for case-sensitive.
    

## Overusing runtime JSON parsing (`parse_json`)

### Problem

Some ingestion pipelines place large JSON payloads into a string field, deferring parsing until query time with `parse_json()`. This is both CPU-intensive and slower than columnar operations.

### Why it matters

- **Repeated parsing overhead**: You pay a performance penalty on each query.
- **Limited indexing**: Axiom cannot index nested fields if they are only known at query time.

### How to fix it

- **Ingest as map fields:** Axiom’s new [map column type](/apl/data-types/map-fields#map-fields) can store object fields column by column, preserving structure and optimizing for nested queries. This allows indexing of specific nested keys.
- **Extract top-level fields where possible:** If a certain nested field is frequently used for filtering or grouping, consider promoting it to its own top-level column (for faster scanning and filtering).
- **Avoid `parse_json()` in query:** If your JSON cannot be flattened entirely, ingest it into a map field. Then query subfields directly:
    
    ```kusto
    dataset
    | where data_map.someKey == "someValue"
    ```

## Virtual fields for simple transformations

### Problem

You can create virtual fields (for example, `extend converted = toint(some_field)`) to transform data at query time. While sometimes necessary, every additional virtual field imposes overhead.

### Why it matters

- **Increased CPU**: Each virtual field requires interpretation by Axiom’s expression engine.
- **Slower queries**: Overuse of `extend` for trivial or frequently repeated operations can add up.

### How to fix it

- **Avoid unnecessary casting:** If a field must be an integer, handle it at ingest time.
    
    **Example:** Instead of
    
    ```kusto
    dataset
    | extend str_user_id = tostring(mixed_user_id)
    | where str_user_id contains "123"
    ```
    
    Use:
    
    ```kusto
    | where mixed_user_id contains "123"
    ```
    
    The filter automatically matches string values in mixed columns.
    
- **Reserve virtual fields for truly dynamic or derived logic**
    
    If you frequently need a computed value, store it at ingest or keep the transformations minimal.
    

## Poor filter order in queries

### Problem

Axiom’s query engine does not currently reorder your `where` clauses optimally. This means the sequence of filters in your query can matter.

### Why it matters

- **Unnecessary scans**: If you use selective filters last, the engine may process many rows before discarding them.
- **Longer execution times**: CPU usage and scan times increase.

### How to fix it

- **Put the most selective filters first:**
    
    Example:
    
    ```kusto
    dataset
    | where user_id == 1234
    | where log_level == "ERROR"
    ```
    
    If `user_id == 1234` discards most rows, apply it before `log_level == "ERROR"`.
    
- **Profile your filters:** Experiment with which filters discard the most rows to find the most selective conditions.
