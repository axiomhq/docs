Axiom is blazing fast. There are nevertheless steps you can take to make it even faster.

Use the guidelines below to optimize datasets and queries for best performance.

## Optimize datasets

Axiom stores event data in a tuned format. As a result:
- The number of distinct values (cardinality) in your data has little impact on performance.
- The number of fields in a dataset (dimensionality) does impact performance.
- The volume of data collected impacts performance.

Scoping the number of fields in a dataset below a few thousand can help you achieve the best performance in Axiom.

## Optimize queries

Axiomâ€™s novel architecture results in remarkable performance. To optimize further, consider the following practices.

### Optimize field-specific filters

Field-specific filters narrow your query results to events where a field has a given value. For example, the APL query `where ["my-field"] == "axiom"` filters for events where the `my-field` field takes the value `axiom`.

Include field-specific filters near the beginning of your query for modest performance improvements.

### Optimize `search` operator and non-field-specific filters

Non-field-specific filters narrow your query results by searching across multiple datasets and fields for a given value. Examples of non-field-specific filters are the `search` operator and equivalent expressions such as `where * contains` or `where * has`.

Using non-field-specific filters degrades performance significantly. For more information, see [Use the `search` operator efficiently](/apl/tabular-operators/search-operator#use-the-search-operator-efficiently).

### Optimize string operators

Different string operators have different impact on performance. Optimizing string operators in your query can significantly improve the performance of your queries. For more information, see [Use the string operators efficiently](/apl/scalar-operators/string-operators#use-string-operators-efficiently).
