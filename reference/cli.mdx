Axiom’s command line interface (CLI) is an Axiom tool that lets you test, manage, and build your Axiom projects by typing commands on the command-line.

You can use the command line to Ingest data, manage authentication state, and configure multiple organizations.

## Installation

### Install using go install

To install Axiom CLI, make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) version 1.16 or higher, then run this command from any directory in your terminal.

```bash
go install github.com/axiomhq/cli/cmd/axiom@latest
```

### Install using Homebrew

You can also install the CLI using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```bash
brew tap axiomhq/tap
brew install axiom
```

This installs Axiom command globally so you can run `axiom` commands from any directory.

To update:

```bash
brew upgrade axiom
```

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axiomhq/cli.git
cd cli
make install # Build and install binary into $GOPATH

```

### Run the Docker image

Docker images are available on [DockerHub.](https://hub.docker.com/r/axiomhq/cli)

```bash
docker pull axiomhq/cli
docker run axiomhq/cli

```

You can check the version and find out basic commands about Axiom CLI by running the following command:

```bash
axiom

```

## Authentication

The easiest way to start using Axiom CLI is by logging in through the command line. Simply run `axiom auth login` or simply `axiom` if no prior configuration exists. This will guide you through a straightforward login process.

## Managing multiple organizations

While most users will only need to manage a single Axiom deployment, Axiom CLI provides the capability to switch between multiple organizations for those who require it. You can easily switch between organizations using straightforward CLI commands. For example, `axiom auth switch-org` lets you change your active organization, or you can set the `AXIOM_ORG_ID` environment variable for the same purpose.

Every setting in Axiom CLI can be overwritten via environment variables configured in the `~/.axiom.toml` file. Specifically, `AXIOM_URL`, `AXIOM_TOKEN`, and `AXIOM_ORG_ID` are important for configuring your environment. The `AXIOM_URL` should be set to `https://api.axiom.co`. You can switch between environments using the `axiom auth select` command.

To view available environment variables, run `axiom help environment` for an up to date list of env vars:

```
AXIOM_DEPLOYMENT: The deployment to use. Overwrites the choice loaded
from the configuration file.

AXIOM_ORG_ID: The organization ID of the organization the access 
token is valid for.

AXIOM_PAGER, PAGER (in order of precedence): A terminal paging
program to send standard output to, for example, "less".

AXIOM_TOKEN: Token The access token to use. Overwrites the choice
loaded from the configuration file.

AXIOM_URL: The deployment url to use. Overwrites the choice loaded
from the configuration file.

VISUAL, EDITOR (in order of precedence): The editor to use for 
authoring text.

NO_COLOR: Set to any value to avoid printing ANSI escape sequences
for color output.

CLICOLOR: Set to "0" to disable printing ANSI colors in output.

CLICOLOR_FORCE: Set to a value other than "0" to keep ANSI colors in 
output even when the output is piped.
```

## One-Click Login

The One-Click Login is an easier way to authenticate Axiom-CLI and log in to your Axiom deployments and account resources directly on your terminal using the Axiom CLI.

## Tokens

You can generate an ingest and personal token manually in your Axiom user settings.

See [Tokens](/reference/tokens) to know more about managing access and authorization.

## Configuration and Deployment

Axiom CLI lets you ingest, authenticate, and stream data.

For more information about Configuration, managing authentication status, ingesting, streaming, and more,
visit the [Axiom CLI](https://github.com/axiomhq/cli) repository on GitHub.

Axiom CLI supports the ingestion of different formats of data **( JSON, NDJSON, and CSV)**

## Querying

Get deeper insights into your data using [Axiom Processing Language](/apl/introduction)

## Ingestion

Import, transfer, load and process data for later use or storage using the Axiom CLI. With [Axiom CLI](https://github.com/axiomhq/cli) you can Ingest the contents of a **JSON, NDJSON, CSV** logfile into a dataset.
