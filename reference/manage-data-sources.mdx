## Datasets

Datasets are collections of related events. They contain incoming event data.

For information on managing datasets for your organization, see [Datasets](/reference/datasets).

2. Click **New endpoint**.
3. Click the type of endpoint you want to create.
4. Name the endpoint.
5. Select the dataset where you want to send data.
6. Copy the URL displayed for the newly created endpoint. This is the target URL where you send the data.

### Delete endpoint
