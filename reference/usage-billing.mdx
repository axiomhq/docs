## Billing

To view details about your next and last bill, go to <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Billing**.

The Current breakdown section explains what you paid for in your last bill and what you can expect to pay for in your next will.

### Understand billing status

Your billing page displays a status indicating the current state of your payment and billing cycle. The following are common billing statuses:

- **Active**: Your payment method is working correctly and your account is in good standing.
- **TBC (To Be Confirmed)**: Your payment is being processed or verified. This typically appears when a new payment method has been added or when your subscription is being set up. The status updates automatically once your payment method is confirmed.
- **Past due**: A payment has failed or is overdue. Update your payment method to avoid service interruption.
- **Incomplete**: Your billing setup is incomplete. Complete the billing setup to activate your account.

<Tip>
If you see "TBC" in your billing status and your payment method is linked correctly, this is normal. The status typically updates within a few hours to a business day as the payment is verified.

### Compute credits

You can save on compute spending by pre-purchasing compute credits. This means that you purchase credits in advance at a discount. The more credits you purchase, the higher the discount rate. For more information, see [Pricing](https://axiom.co/pricing).

Your compute credits can cover the following costs:
- Data loading
- Query compute

Your compute credits can’t cover the following costs:
- Your pricing plan
- Add-ons
- Storage

To purchase compute credits:

1. Ensure you have permissions to modify billing. For more information, see [Role-Based Access Control](/reference/settings).
1. Go to <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Billing**.
1. In the Compute credits section, click **Add credits**.
1. Enter the amount of credits you want to purchase.
1. Review the total cost.
1. Click **Buy credits**.
1. Complete the purchase.

### Spending limit

Setting a monthly spending limit allows you to control costs.

<Warning>
The spending limit takes into account the costs you’re billed for at the end of your billing period. If your organization reaches the spend limit in a billing period, Axiom immediately prevents actions that generate further costs. For example, if you have used up the allowances included in your pricing plan, you can’t run queries or ingest more data, and your monitors can’t query your data. This can cause interruptions to your service.
</Warning>

Even if you reach your spending limit, you can still initiate purchases manually such as buying add-ons and credits.

To set a monthly spending limit:

1. Ensure you have permissions to modify billing. For more information, see [Role-Based Access Control](/reference/settings).
1. Go to <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Billing**.
1. In the Limit section, click **Manage limit**.
1. Turn on **Set monthly spending limit**.
1. Enter the maximum monthly spending.
1. Click **Save changes**.

<Info>
If your organization reaches the spend limit, Axiom sends an email to the owner of your organization. To avoid further interruptions to your service, increase the spend limit. Your service resumes until usage-related costs reach the amount by which you increased the limit. The spend limit resets in the next billable period as usual.
