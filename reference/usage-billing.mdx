1. In the Current breakdown section, click **Billing history**.

### Compute credits

You can save on compute spending by pre-purchasing compute credits. This means that you purchase credits in advance at a discount. The more credits you purchase, the higher the discount rate. For more information, see [Pricing](https://axiom.co/pricing).

Your compute credits can cover the following costs:
- Data loading
- Query compute

Your compute credits can’t cover the following costs:
- Your pricing plan
- Add-ons
- Storage

To purchase compute credits:

1. Ensure you have permissions to modify billing. For more information, see [Role-Based Access Control](/reference/settings).
1. Go to <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Billing**.
1. In the Compute credits section, click **Add credits**.
1. Enter the amount of credits you want to purchase.
1. Review the total cost.
1. Click **Buy credits**.
1. Complete the purchase.

### Spending limit

Setting a monthly spending limit allows you to control costs.

<Warning>
Axiom continuously tracks your current billing cycle’s projected costs. To determine your accumulated charges, Axiom considers all costs, including the base cost of your plan, usage costs, and the costs of any add-ons you have purchased. When your accumulated charges approach or reach your spending limit, Axiom automatically pauses actions that generate further costs. This can cause interruptions to your service.

For example, if you have used up the query compute allowance included in your pricing plan, you can’t run queries and your monitors can’t query your data. At the same time, if you haven’t yet used up the data loading allowance, you can still ingest data.
</Warning>

Even if you reach your spending limit, you can still initiate purchases manually such as buying add-ons and credits.

To set a monthly spending limit:

1. Ensure you have permissions to modify billing. For more information, see [Role-Based Access Control](/reference/settings).
1. Go to <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Billing**.
1. In the Limit section, click **Manage limit**.
1. Turn on **Set monthly spending limit**.
1. Enter the maximum monthly spending.
1. Click **Save changes**.

<Info>
If your organization reaches the spend limit, Axiom sends an email to the owner of your organization. To avoid further interruptions to your service, increase the spend limit. Your service resumes until usage-related costs reach the amount by which you increased the limit. The spend limit resets in the next billable period as usual.
