### Compute credits

You can save on compute spending by pre-purchasing compute credits. This means that you purchase credits in advance at a discount. The more credits you purchase, the higher the discount rate. For more information, see [Pricing](https://axiom.co/pricing).

Your compute credits can cover the following costs:
- Data loading
- Query compute

Your compute credits can’t cover the following costs:
- Your pricing plan
- Add-ons
- Storage

To purchase compute credits:

1. Go to <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Billing**.
1. In the Compute credits section, click **Add credits**.

1. Click **Buy credits**.
1. Complete the purchase.

### Spending limit

Setting a monthly spending limit allows you to control usage-related costs.

<Warning>
If your organization reaches the spend limit in a month, Axiom prevents actions that generate further usage costs. For example, you can’t run queries and monitors can’t query your data. This can cause interruptions to your service.
</Warning>

To set a monthly spending limit:

1. Go to <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Billing**.
1. In the Limit section, click **Manage limit**.
