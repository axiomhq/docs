OpenTelemetry provides a [unified approach to collecting telemetry data](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/net/) from your .NET applications. This guide explains how to configure OpenTelemetry in a .NET application to send telemetry data to Axiom using the OpenTelemetry SDK.

## Prerequisites

- [Create an Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/).
- [Create a dataset](/reference/settings#data) where you want to send data.
- [Create an API token in Axiom with permissions to ingest and query data](/reference/tokens).
- Install the .NET 6.0 SDK on your development machine.
- Use your existing .NET application or start with the sample provided in the `program.cs` below.

## Install dependencies

Run the following command in your terminal to install the necessary NuGet packages:

```bash
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry --version 1.7.0
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console --version 1.7.0
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol --version 1.7.0
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting --version 1.7.0
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore --version 1.7.1
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http --version 1.6.0-rc.1
```

Replace the `dotnet.csproj` file in your project with the following:

```csharp
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry" Version="1.7.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console" Version="1.7.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol" Version="1.7.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting" Version="1.7.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore" Version="1.7.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http" Version="1.6.0-rc.1" />

  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

The `dotnet.csproj` file is important for defining your project’s settings, including target framework, nullable reference types, and package references. It informs the .NET SDK and build tools about the components and configurations your project requires.

## Core application

`program.cs` is the core of the .NET application. It uses ASP.NET to create a simple web server. The server has an endpoint `/rolldice` that returns a random number, simulating a basic API.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using System;
using System.Globalization;

// Set up the web application builder
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
// Configure OpenTelemetry for detailed tracing information
TracingConfiguration.ConfigureOpenTelemetry();
var app = builder.Build();

// Map the GET request for '/rolldice/{player?}' to a handler
app.MapGet("/rolldice/{player?}", (ILogger<Program> logger, string? player) =>
{
    // Start a manual tracing activity
    using var activity = TracingConfiguration.StartActivity("HandleRollDice");
    
    // Call the RollDice function to get a dice roll result
    var result = RollDice();

    if (activity != null)
    {
        // Add detailed information to the tracing activity for debugging and monitoring
        activity.SetTag("player.name", player ?? "anonymous"); // Tag the player’s name, default to 'anonymous' if not provided
        activity.SetTag("dice.rollResult", result); // Tag the result of the dice roll
        activity.SetTag("operation.success", true); // Flag the operation as successful
        activity.SetTag("custom.attribute", "Additional detail here"); // Add a custom attribute for potential further detail
    }

    // Log the dice roll event
    LogRollDice(logger, player, result);

    // Retur the dice roll result as a string
    return result.ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
});

// Start the web application
app.Run();

// Log function to log the result of a dice roll
void LogRollDice(ILogger logger, string? player, int result)
{
    // Log message varies based on whether a player’s name is provided
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(player))
    {
        // Log for an anonymous player
        logger.LogInformation("Anonymous player is rolling the dice: {result}", result);
    }
    else
    {
        // Log for a named player
        logger.LogInformation("{player} is rolling the dice: {result}", player, result);
    }
}

// Function to roll a dice and return a random number between 1 and 6
int RollDice()
{
    // Use the shared instance of Random for thread safety
    return Random.Shared.Next(1, 7);
}

```

## Exporter

The `tracing.cs` file sets up the OpenTelemetry instrumentation. It configures the OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) exporters for traces and initializes the ASP.NET  SDK with automatic instrumentation capabilities.

```csharp
using OpenTelemetry;
using OpenTelemetry.Resources;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Reflection;

// Class to configure OpenTelemetry tracing
public static class TracingConfiguration
{
    // Declare an ActivitySource for creating tracing activities
    private static readonly ActivitySource ActivitySource = new("MyCustomActivitySource");

    // Configure OpenTelemetry with custom settings and instrumentation
    public static void ConfigureOpenTelemetry()
    {
        // Retrieve the service name and version from the executing assembly metadata
        var serviceName = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Name ?? "UnknownService";
        var serviceVersion = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Version?.ToString() ?? "UnknownVersion";

        // Set up the tracer provider with various configurations
        Sdk.CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
            .SetResourceBuilder(
                // Set resource attributes including service name and version
                ResourceBuilder.CreateDefault().AddService(serviceName, serviceVersion: serviceVersion)
                .AddAttributes(new[] { new KeyValuePair<string, object>("environment", "development") }) // Additional attributes
                .AddTelemetrySdk() // Add telemetry SDK information to the traces
                .AddEnvironmentVariableDetector()) // Detect resource attributes from environment variables
            .AddSource(ActivitySource.Name) // Add the ActivitySource defined above
            .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation() // Add automatic instrumentation for ASP.NET Core
            .AddHttpClientInstrumentation() // Add automatic instrumentation for HttpClient requests
            .AddOtlpExporter(options => // Configure the OTLP exporter
            {
                options.Endpoint = new Uri("https://api.axiom.co/v1/traces"); // Set the endpoint for the exporter
                options.Protocol = OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OtlpExportProtocol.HttpProtobuf; // Set the protocol
                options.Headers = "Authorization=Bearer API_TOKEN, X-Axiom-Dataset=DATASET"; // Update API token and dataset
            })
            .Build(); // Build the tracer provider
    }

    // Method to start a new tracing activity with an optional activity kind
    public static Activity? StartActivity(string activityName, ActivityKind kind = ActivityKind.Internal)
    {
        // Starts and returns a new activity if sampling allows it, otherwise returns null
        return ActivitySource.StartActivity(activityName, kind);
    }
}
```

In the `tracing.cs` file, make the following changes:

- Replace the value of the `serviceName` variable with the name of the service you want to trace. This is used for identifying and categorizing trace data, particularly in systems with multiple services.
- Replace `API_TOKEN` with your Axiom API key.
- Replace `DATASET_NAME` with the name of the Axiom dataset where you want to send data.

## Run the instrumented application

1. Run in local development mode using the development settings in `appsettings.development.json`. Ensure your Axiom API token and dataset name are correctly set in `tracing.cs`.

2. Before deploying, run in production mode by switching to `appsettings.json` for production settings. Ensure your Axiom API token and dataset name are correctly set in `tracing.cs`.

3. Run your application with `dotnet run`. Your application starts and you can interact with it by sending requests to the `/rolldice` endpoint. 

For example, if you are using port `8080`, your application is accessible locally at `http://localhost:8080/rolldice`. This URL will direct your requests to the `/rolldice` endpoint of your server running on your local machine.

## Observe the telemetry data

As you interact with your application, traces are collected and exported to Axiom where you can monitor and analyze your application’s performance and behavior.

1. Log into your Axiom account and click the **Datasets** or **Stream** tab.

2. Select your dataset from the list.

3. From the list of fields, click on the **trace_id**, to view your spans.

## Dynamic OpenTelemetry Traces dashboard

The data can then be further viewed and analyzed in the traces dashboard, providing insights into the performance and behavior of your application.

1. Log into your Axiom account, select **Dashboards**, and click on the traces dashboard named after your dataset.

2. View the dashboard which displays your total traces, incoming spans, average span duration, errors, slowest operations, and top 10 span errors across services.


## Send data from an existing .NET project

### Manual Instrumentation

Manual instrumentation involves adding code to create, configure, and manage telemetry data, such as traces and spans, providing control over what data is collected.

1. Initialize ActivitySource. Define an `ActivitySource` to create activities (spans) for tracing specific operations within your application. 

```csharp
private static readonly ActivitySource MyActivitySource = new ActivitySource("MyActivitySourceName");
```

2. Start and stop activities. Manually start activities (spans) at the beginning of the operations you want to trace and stop them when the operations complete. You can add custom attributes to these activities for more detailed tracing.

```csharp
using var activity = MyActivitySource.StartActivity("MyOperationName");
activity?.SetTag("key", "value");
// Perform the operation here
activity?.Stop();
```

3. Add custom attributes. Enhance activities with custom attributes to provide additional context, making it easier to analyze telemetry data.

```csharp
activity?.SetTag("UserId", userId);
activity?.SetTag("OperationDetail", "Detail about the operation");
```

### Automatic Instrumentation

Automatic instrumentation uses the OpenTelemetry SDK and additional libraries to automatically generate telemetry data for certain operations, such as incoming HTTP requests and database queries.

1. Configure OpenTelemetry SDK. Use the OpenTelemetry SDK to configure automatic instrumentation in your application. This typically involves setting up a `TracerProvider` in your `program.cs` or startup configuration, which automatically captures telemetry data from supported libraries.

```csharp
Sdk.CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
    .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
    .AddHttpClientInstrumentation()
    .AddOtlpExporter(options =>
    {
        options.Endpoint = new Uri("https://api.axiom.co/v1/traces");
        // Ensure to replace YOUR_API_TOKEN and YOUR_DATASET_NAME with your actual API token and dataset name
        options.Headers = $"Authorization=Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN, X-Axiom-Dataset=YOUR_DATASET_NAME";
    })
    .Build();
```

2. Install and configure additional OpenTelemetry instrumentation packages as needed, based on the technologies your application uses. For example, to automatically trace SQL database queries, you might add the corresponding database instrumentation package.

3. With automatic instrumentation set up, no further code changes are required for tracing basic operations. The OpenTelemetry SDK and its instrumentation packages handle the creation and management of traces for supported operations.
