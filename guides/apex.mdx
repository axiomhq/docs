Use the adapter of the Axiom Go SDK to send logs generated by the [apex/log](https://github.com/apex/log) library to Axiom.

<Note>
The Axiom Go SDK is an open-source project and welcomes your contributions. For more information, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go).
</Note>

<Prerequisites />

## Set up SDK

1. Install the Axiom Go SDK and configure your environment as explained in [Send data from Go app to Axiom](/guides/go).
1. In your Go app, import the `apex` package. It’s imported as an `adapter` so that it doesn’t conflict with the `apex/log` package.

    ```go
    import adapter "github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go/adapters/apex"
    ```

    Alternatively, configure the adapter using [options](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go/adapters/apex#Option) passed to the [New](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go/adapters/apex#New) function:

    ```go
    handler, err := adapter.New(
        adapter.SetDataset("DATASET_NAME"),
    )
    ```

    <ReplaceDataset />

## Configure client

To configure the underlying client manually, choose one of the following:

- Use [SetClient](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go/adapters/apex#SetClient) to pass in the client you have previously created with [Send data from Go app to Axiom](/guides/go).
- Use [SetClientOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go/adapters/apex#SetClientOptions) to pass [client options](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go/axiom#Option) to the adapter.

    ```go
    import (
        "github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go/axiom"
        adapter "github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go/adapters/apex"
    )

    // ...

    handler, err := adapter.New(
        adapter.SetClientOptions(
            axiom.SetPersonalTokenConfig("AXIOM_TOKEN"),
        ),
    )
    ```

<Note>
The adapter uses a buffer to batch events before sending them to Axiom. Flush this buffer explicitly by calling [Close](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go/adapters/apex#Handler.Close). For more information, see the [example in GitHub](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go/blob/main/examples/apex/main.go).
</Note>

## Reference

For a full reference of the adapter’s functions, see the [Go Packages page](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go/adapters/apex).
