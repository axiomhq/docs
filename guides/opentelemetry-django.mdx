<Prerequisites />
- [Install Python version 3.7 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Install required dependencies

Install the necessary Python dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install django opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http opentelemetry-instrumentation-django
```

Alternatively, you can add these dependencies to your `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
django
opentelemetry-api
opentelemetry-sdk
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http
opentelemetry-instrumentation-django
```

Then, install them using the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Get started with a Django project

1. Create a new Django project if you don’t have one already:

```bash
django-admin startproject your_project_name
```

2. Go to your project directory:

```bash
cd your_project_name
```

3. Create a Django app:

```bash
python manage.py startapp your_app_name
```

## Set up OpenTelemetry Tracing

### Update `manage.py` to initialize tracing

This code initializes OpenTelemetry instrumentation for Django when the project is run. Adding `DjangoInstrumentor().instrument()` ensures that all incoming HTTP requests are automatically traced, which helps in monitoring the app’s performance and behavior without manually adding trace points in every view.

```py
# manage.py

#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
import sys
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.django import DjangoInstrumentor

def main():
    """Run administrative tasks."""
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project_name.settings')

    # Initialize OpenTelemetry instrumentation
    DjangoInstrumentor().instrument()

    try:
        from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
    except ImportError as exc:
        raise ImportError(
            "Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and "
            "available on your PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did you "
            "forget to activate a virtual environment?"
        ) from exc
    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Create `exporter.py` for tracer configuration

This file configures the OpenTelemetry tracing provider and exporter. By setting up a `TracerProvider` and configuring the `OTLPSpanExporter`, you define how and where the trace data is sent. The `BatchSpanProcessor` is used to batch and send trace spans efficiently. The tracer created at the end is used throughout the app to create new spans.

```py
# exporter.py

from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource, SERVICE_NAME
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter

# Define the service name resource
resource = Resource(attributes={
    SERVICE_NAME: "your-service-name"  # Replace with your actual service name
})

# Create a TracerProvider with the defined resource
provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)

# Configure the OTLP/HTTP Span Exporter with necessary headers and endpoint
otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(
    endpoint="https://AXIOM_DOMAIN/v1/traces",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer API_TOKEN",  # Replace with your actual API token
        "X-Axiom-Dataset": "DATASET_NAME"    # Replace with your dataset name
    }
)

# Create a BatchSpanProcessor with the OTLP exporter
processor = BatchSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter)
provider.add_span_processor(processor)

# Set the TracerProvider as the global tracer provider
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

# Define a tracer for external use
tracer = trace.get_tracer("your-service-name")
```

<ReplaceDatasetToken />
</Info>

### Use the tracer in your views

In this step, modify the Django views to use the tracer defined in `exporter.py`. By wrapping the view logic within `tracer.start_as_current_span`, you create spans that capture the execution of these views. This provides detailed insights into the performance of individual request handlers, helping to identify slow operations or errors.

```py
# views.py

from django.http import HttpResponse
from .exporter import tracer  # Import the tracer

def roll_dice(request):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("roll_dice_span"):
        # Your logic here
        return HttpResponse("Dice rolled!")

def home(request):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("home_span"):
        return HttpResponse("Welcome to the homepage!")
```

### Update `settings.py` for OpenTelemetry instrumentation

In your Django project’s `settings.py`, add the OpenTelemetry Django instrumentation. This setup automatically creates spans for HTTP requests handled by Django:

```py
# settings.py

from pathlib import Path
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.django import DjangoInstrumentor

DjangoInstrumentor().instrument()

# Build paths inside the project like this: BASE_DIR / 'subdir'.
BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
```

### Update the app’s urls.py to include the views

Include your views in the URL routing by updating [`urls.py`](http://urls.py) Updating `urls.py` with these entries sets up the URL routing for the Django app. It connects the URL paths to the corresponding view functions. This ensures that when users visit the specified paths, the corresponding views are executed, and their spans are created and sent to Axiom for monitoring.

```python
# urls.py

from django.urls import path
from .views import roll_dice, home

urlpatterns = [
    path('', home, name='home'),
    path('rolldice/', roll_dice, name='roll_dice'),
]
```

## Run the project

Run the command to start the Django project:

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

In your browser, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/rolldice` to interact with your Django app. Each time you load the page, the app displays a message and sends the collected traces to Axiom.

## Send data from an existing Django project

### Manual instrumentation

Manual instrumentation in Python with OpenTelemetry involves adding code to create and manage spans around the blocks of code you want to trace. This approach allows for precise control over the trace data.

1. Install necessary OpenTelemetry packages to enable manual tracing capabilities in your Django app.

    ```py
    pip install django opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http opentelemetry-instrumentation-django
    ```

2. Set up OpenTelemetry in your Django project to manually trace app activities.

    ```py
    # otel_config.py
    from opentelemetry import trace
    from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
    from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

    def configure_opentelemetry():
        resource = Resource(attributes={"service.name": "your-django-app"})
        trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider(resource=resource))
        otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(
            endpoint="https://AXIOM_DOMAIN/v1/traces",
            headers={"Authorization": "Bearer API_TOKEN", "X-Axiom-Dataset": "DATASET_NAME"}
        )
        span_processor = BatchSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter)
        trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(span_processor)
        return trace.get_tracer(__name__)

    tracer = configure_opentelemetry()
    ```

    <Info>
    <ReplaceDomain />
    <ReplaceDatasetToken />
    </Info>

3. Configure OpenTelemetry to your Django settings to capture telemetry data upon app startup.

```py
# settings.py
from otel_config import configure_opentelemetry
configure_opentelemetry()
```

4. Manually instrument views to create custom spans that trace specific operations within your Django app.

```py
# views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
from otel_config import tracer

def home_view(request):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("home_view") as span:
        span.set_attribute("http.method", request.method)
        span.set_attribute("http.url", request.build_absolute_uri())
        response = HttpResponse("Welcome to the home page!")
        span.set_attribute("http.status_code", response.status_code)
        return response
```

5. Apply manual tracing to database operations by wrapping database cursor executions with OpenTelemetry spans.

```py
# db_tracing.py
from django.db import connections
from otel_config import tracer

class TracingCursorWrapper:
    def __init__(self, cursor):
        self.cursor = cursor
    def execute(self, sql, params=None):
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("database_query") as span:
            span.set_attribute("db.statement", sql)
            span.set_attribute("db.type", "sql")
            return self.cursor.execute(sql, params)
    def __getattr__(self, attr):
        return getattr(self.cursor, attr)

def patch_database():
    for connection in connections.all():
        connection.cursor_wrapper = TracingCursorWrapper

# settings.py
from db_tracing import patch_database
patch_database()
```

### Automatic instrumentation

Automatic instrumentation in Django with OpenTelemetry simplifies the process of adding telemetry data to your app. It uses pre-built libraries that automatically instrument the frameworks and libraries.

1. Install required packages that support automatic instrumentation.

    ```bash
    pip install django opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http opentelemetry-instrumentation-django
    ```

2. Automatically configure OpenTelemetry to trace Django app operations without manual span management.

    ```py
    # otel_config.py
    from opentelemetry import trace
    from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
    from opentelemetry.instrumentation.django import DjangoInstrumentor
    from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

    def configure_opentelemetry():
        resource = Resource(attributes={"service.name": "your-django-app"})
        trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider(resource=resource))
        otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(
            endpoint="https://AXIOM_DOMAIN/v1/traces",
            headers={"Authorization": "Bearer API_TOKEN", "X-Axiom-Dataset": "DATASET_NAME"}
        )
        span_processor = BatchSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter)
        trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(span_processor)
        DjangoInstrumentor().instrument()
    ```

    <Info>
    <ReplaceDomain />
    <ReplaceDatasetToken />
    </Info>

3. Initialize OpenTelemetry in Django to capture telemetry data from all HTTP requests automatically.

```py
# settings.py
from otel_config import configure_opentelemetry
configure_opentelemetry()
```

4. Update `manage.py` to include OpenTelemetry initialization, ensuring that tracing is active before the Django app fully starts.

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
import sys
def main():
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')
    from otel_config import configure_opentelemetry
    configure_opentelemetry()
    try:
        from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
    except ImportError as exc:
        raise ImportError("Couldn't import Django.") from exc
    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

5. (Optional) Combine automatic and custom manual spans in Django views to enhance trace details for specific complex operations.

```py
# views.py
from opentelemetry import trace
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
def complex_view(request):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("complex_operation"):
        result = perform_complex_operation()
    return HttpResponse(result)
```

### List of imported libraries

The `exporter.py` file and other relevant parts of the Django OpenTelemetry setup import the following libraries:

### `exporter.py`

This module creates and manages trace data in your app. It creates spans and tracers which track the execution flow and performance of your app.

```py
from opentelemetry import trace
```

TracerProvider acts as a container for the configuration of your app’s tracing behavior. It allows you to define how spans are generated and processed, essentially serving as the central point for managing trace creation and propagation in your app.

```py
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
```

BatchSpanProcessor is responsible for batching spans before they’re exported. This is an important aspect of efficient trace data management as it aggregates multiple spans into fewer network requests, reducing the overhead on your app’s performance and the tracing backend.

```py
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
```

The Resource class is used to describe your app’s service attributes, such as its name, version, and environment. This contextual information is attached to the traces and helps in identifying and categorizing trace data, making it easier to filter and analyze in your monitoring setup.

```py
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource, SERVICE_NAME
```

The OTLPSpanExporter is responsible for sending your app’s trace data to a backend that supports the OTLP such as Axiom. It formats the trace data according to the OTLP standards and transmits it over HTTP, ensuring compatibility and standardization in how telemetry data is sent across different systems and services.

```py
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
```

### `manage.py`

The DjangoInstrumentor module is used to automatically instrument Django applications. It integrates OpenTelemetry with Django, enabling automatic creation of spans for incoming HTTP requests handled by Django, and simplifying the process of adding telemetry to your app.

```py
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.django import DjangoInstrumentor
```

### `views.py`

This import brings in the tracer instance defined in `exporter.py`, which is used to create spans for tracing the execution of Django views. By wrapping view logic within `tracer.start_as_current_span`, it captures detailed insights into the performance of individual request handlers.

```py
from .exporter import tracer
```
