The Datasets tab allows you to gain a better understanding of the fields you have in your datasets.

In Axiom, an individual piece of data is an event, and a dataset is a collection of related events. Datasets contain incoming event data. The Datasets tab provides you with information about each field within your datasets.

## Datasets overview

When you open the Datasets tab, you see the list of datasets on the left. To explore the fields in a dataset, select the dataset from the list on the left.

On the right, you see the following:
- The list of integration dashboards appears on the Datasets overview page. These are prebuilt dashboards automatically generated by Axiom to enhance your experience. For more information, see [Apps](/apps).
- The list of [starred queries](#starred-queries)
- The [query history](#query-history)

## Fields list

When you select a dataset, Axiom displays the list of fields within the dataset.

The field types are the following:
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Array
- [Virtual fields](#virtual-fields)

This view flattens field names with dot notation. This means that the event `{"foo": { "bar": "baz" }}` appears as `foo.bar`. Field names containing periods (`.`) are folded.

### Edit field

Click the field name to change the following:
- Change the field description.
- Change the field unit. This is only available for number field types.
- Hide the field. This means that the field is still present in the underlying Axiom database, but it doesn’t appear in the Axiom UI. Use this option if you sent the field to Axiom by mistake or you don’t want to use it anymore in Axiom.

## Quick charts

TODO

Quick charts allow fast charting of fields depending on their field type. For example, number fields have quick charts for easily visualizing percentiles, averages, and histograms.

## Virtual fields

Virtual fields are powerful expressions that run on every event during a query to create new fields. The virtual fields are calculated from the events in the query using an APL expression. They’re similar to tools like derived-columns in other products but super-charged with an expressive interpreter and with the flexibility to add/edit/remove them at any time.

Click **Virtual fields** on the toolbar to manage of a dataset’s virtual fields.

## Starred queries

Starred queries are queries saved for future use. They’re great for keeping a list of useful queries for a dataset. All starred queries are shared with your team.

Click **Starred queries** on the toolbar to manage starred queries.

## Query history

Every query you and your team members run is given a unique ID and saved inside Axiom. Use the query history to share results with other members or find a past query that you want to star for future use.

Click **Query History** on the toolbar:

You see historical queries in reverse-chronological order. You can choose between your own queries or those of your team:
