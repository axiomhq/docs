The Datasets tab allows you to gain a better understanding of the fields you have in your datasets.

In Axiom, an individual piece of data is an event, and a dataset is a collection of related events. Datasets contain incoming event data. The Datasets tab provides you with information about each field within your datasets.

## Datasets overview

When you open the Datasets tab, you see the list of datasets on the left. To explore the fields in a dataset, select the dataset from the list on the left.

On the right, you see the following:
- Integration dashboards appear on the Datasets overview page. These are prebuilt dashboards that Axiom automatically generates to enhance your experience. For more information, see [Apps](/apps).
- The list of [starred queries](#starred-queries).
- The [query history](#query-history).

## Fields list

When you select a dataset, Axiom displays the list of fields within the dataset.

The field types are the following:
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Array
- [Virtual fields](#virtual-fields)

This view flattens field names with dot notation. This means that the event `{"foo": { "bar": "baz" }}` appears as `foo.bar`. Field names containing periods (`.`) are folded.

### Edit field

Click the field name to change the following:
- Change the field description.
- Change the field unit (available only for number field types).
- Hide the field. When you hide a field, it remains in the underlying Axiom database but doesn't appear in the Axiom UI. Use this option if you sent the field to Axiom by mistake or don't want to use it anymore in Axiom.

## Quick charts

Quick charts allow fast charting of fields depending on their field type. For number fields, choose one of the following visualization options:
- <img src="/doc-assets/icons/percent.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Percent icon" /> Percentiles
- <img src="/doc-assets/icons/stopwatch.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Stopwatch icon" /> Averages
- <img src="/doc-assets/icons/chart-scatter.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Scatter chart icon" /> Histograms

## Virtual fields

Virtual fields are powerful expressions that run on every event during a query to create new fields. The virtual fields are calculated from the events in the query using an APL expression. They're similar to tools like derived columns in other products but are enhanced with an expressive interpreter and the flexibility to add, edit, or remove them at any time.

To manage a dataset's virtual fields, click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/virtual-fields.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Virtual fields icon" /> in the toolbar.

## Queries

Every query has a unique ID that you can save and share with your team members. The Datasets tab allows you to:
- Find a past query.
- Run previously saved queries.
- Star a query so that you and your team members can easily find it in the future.

### Recent queries

To find and run recent queries:
1. Click **Query library** in the toolbar.
1. Click the **Recent** tab.
1. Optional: In the top right, select whether to display <img src="/doc-assets/icons/single-user.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Single user icon" /> your queries or <img src="/doc-assets/icons/many-users.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Many users icon" /> your team's queries.
1. Find the query in the list, and then click it to run the query.

### Saved queries

To find and run previously saved queries:
1. Click **Query library** in the toolbar.
1. Click the **Saved** tab.
1. Optional: In the top right, select whether to display <img src="/doc-assets/icons/single-user.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Single user icon" /> your queries or <img src="/doc-assets/icons/many-users.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Many users icon" /> your team's queries.
1. Find the query in the list, and then click it to run the query.

### Starred queries

In the **Starred queries** section on the right, you see queries saved for future use. They're ideal for keeping a list of useful queries for a dataset. All starred queries are shared with your team.
