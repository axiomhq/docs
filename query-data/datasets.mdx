The Datasets tab allows you to gain a better understanding of the fields you have in your datasets.

In Axiom, an individual piece of data is an event, and a dataset is a collection of related events. Datasets contain incoming event data. The Datasets tab provides you with information about each field within your datasets.

## Datasets overview

When you open the Datasets tab, you see the list of datasets. To explore the fields in a dataset, select the dataset from the list on the left.

When you select a dataset, Axiom displays the list of fields within the dataset on the left. The field types are the following:
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Array
- [Virtual fields](#virtual-fields)

This view flattens field names with dot notation. This means that the event `{"foo": { "bar": "baz" }}` appears as `foo.bar`. Field names containing periods (`.`) are folded.

On the right, you see the following:
- [Views](#views)
- [Starred queries](#starred-queries)
- [Query history](#query-history)

### Edit field

To edit a field:

1. To the right of the field, click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/ellipsis-vertical.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Vertical ellipsis icon" /> **More > Manage field**.
1. Edit the following:
    - Field description.
    - Field unit. This is only available for number field types.
    - Hide the field. This means that the field is still present in the underlying Axiom database, but it doesn’t appear in the Axiom UI. Use this option if you sent the field to Axiom by mistake or you don’t want to use it anymore in Axiom.

## Quick charts

Quick charts allow fast charting of fields depending on their field type. For example, for number fields, choose one of the following for easily visualizing
- <img src="/doc-assets/icons/percent.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Percent icon" /> Percentiles
- <img src="/doc-assets/icons/stopwatch.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Stopwatch icon" /> Averages
- <img src="/doc-assets/icons/chart-scatter.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Scatter chart icon" /> Histograms

## Virtual fields

Virtual fields are powerful expressions that run on every event during a query to create new fields. The virtual fields are calculated from the events in the query using an APL expression. They’re similar to tools like derived columns in other products but super-charged with an expressive interpreter and with the flexibility to add, edit, or remove them at any time.

To manage a dataset’s virtual fields, click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/virtual-fields.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Virtual fields icon" /> in the toolbar.

For more information, see [Virtual fields](/query-data/virtual-fields).

## Map fields

Map fields are a special type of field that can hold a collection of nested key-value pairs within a single field. You can think of the content of a map field as a JSON object. The Dataset tab enables you to create map fields, and view unused and removed map fields. For more information, see [Map fields](/apl/data-types/map-fields#create-map-fields).

## Views

Views allow you to grant other users scoped access to your datasets. This means that instead of sharing the whole dataset with other users, you have the option to share only a filtered and transformed representation of the data. You define a view using a query that applies filters and transformations to your dataset, and then you only share the results of this query with another user.

### Create view

1. Select a dataset.
1. In the top right of the **Views** section, click **+ Create view**.
1. Create the query using the [visual query builder](/query-data/explore#create-a-query-using-the-visual-query-builder) or the [Axiom Processing Language (APL)](/query-data/explore#create-a-query-using-apl).
1. Below the query, check the preview of the events and the fields that your query returns.
1. Name the view and optionally add a description.
1. Click **Create view**.

### Display view

1. Select a dataset.
1. In the **Views** section on the right, click the view you want to display.

### Grant access to view

To grant other users access to a view:

1. Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Roles**.
1. Click the role with which you want to share the view or create a new role.
1. In the **Organization** section, enable read access to views.
1. In the **Individual datasets** section, click **Add dataset**. 
1. Start typing the name of the view. In the list, find the view that you want to share, and then click **Add**.
    <Note>
        It’s enough to grant access to the view. You don’t need to grant access to the underlying dataset.
    </Note>
1. Click **Save**.

## Queries

Every query has a unique ID that you can save and share with your team members. The Datasets tab allows you to do the following:
- Star a query so that you and your team members can easily find it in the future.
- Browse previous queries and find a past query.

### Starred queries

To find and run previously starred queries:

1. Select a dataset.
1. Optional: In the top right of the **Starred queries** section, select whether to display <img src="/doc-assets/icons/single-user.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Single user icon" /> your queries or <img src="/doc-assets/icons/many-users.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Many users icon" /> your team’s queries.
1. Find the query in the list, and then click it to run the query.

### Query history

To find and run recent queries:

1. Select a dataset.
1. Optional: In the top right of the **Query history** section, select whether to display <img src="/doc-assets/icons/single-user.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Single user icon" /> your queries or <img src="/doc-assets/icons/many-users.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Many users icon" /> your team’s queries.
1. Find the query in the list, and then click it to run the query.
