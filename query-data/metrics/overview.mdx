Axiom supports ingesting, querying, and visualizing OpenTelemetry (OTel) metrics alongside logs and traces. This section explains how to work with OTel metrics in Axiom.

<Info>
Support for OTel metrics is currently in public preview. For more information, see [Feature states](/platform-overview/roadmap#feature-states).
</Info>

<Prerequisites />

<Note>
You must use a dedicated dataset for OTel metrics. When you create a dataset, select the type of OTel data you want to send to it. For more information, see [Create dataset](/reference/datasets#create-dataset).
</Note>

## Ingest metrics

You can ingest OTel metrics the same way you ingest logs and traces.

For more information, see [Send OpenTelemetry data to Axiom](/send-data/opentelemetry).

## Query metrics

You can query metric data using AxQL, a purpose-built query language designed for metrics. AxQL blends the familiar syntax of the APL family with metric-specific features inspired by PromQL, while maintaining strong integration with Axiomâ€™s data model and performance architecture.

For more information, see [Query metrics](/query-data/metrics/query-metrics) and [Sample queries](/query-data/metrics/sample-queries).

## Dashboards and monitors

You can use OTel metrics in dashboards and monitors the same way you use logs and traces.

- Build visualizations using AxQL queries.
- Set alerts on derived metrics such as error rate or latency percentiles.
- Combine multiple signals in a single panel.

For more information, see [Dashboards](/dashboards/overview) and [Monitors](/monitor-data/monitors).

## Migrate queries

If you use PromQL, you can translate your queries into AxQL with minimal changes. AxQL also offers features not available in PromQL, such as cross-dataset querying, native support for non-string tag types, and custom transformation pipelines.

For more information, see [Migrate PromQL queries to Axiom](/query-data/metrics/migrate-metrics)
