Axiom supports ingesting, querying, and visualizing OpenTelemetry (OTel) metrics alongside logs and traces. This section explains how to work with OTel metrics in Axiom.

<Info>
Support for OTel metrics is currently in private preview. For more information, see [Feature states](/platform-overview/roadmap#feature-states).
</Info>

<Prerequisites />

<Note>
You must use a dedicated dataset for OTel metrics. When you create a dataset, select the type of OTel data you want to send to it. For more information, see [Create dataset](/reference/datasets#create-dataset).
</Note>

## Ingest metrics

You can ingest OTel metrics the same way you ingest logs and traces.

For more information, see [Send OpenTelemetry data to Axiom](/send-data/opentelemetry).

## Query metrics

You can query metric data using the Axiom Console. For more information, see [Query metrics](/query-data/metrics/query-metrics).

## Dashboards and monitors

You can use OTel metrics in dashboards and monitors the same way you use logs and traces.

- Build visualizations using metrics queries.
- Set alerts on derived metrics such as error rate or latency percentiles.
- Combine multiple signals in a single panel.

For more information, see [Dashboards](/dashboards/overview) and [Monitors](/monitor-data/monitors).

## Current limitations

You can only query one dataset in a query.

Axiom doesn’t support the following data types:
- Exponential histograms
- `bytes`, `kvlist`, and `array` tag value types
- Exemplar, baggage, and context data
- Nanosecond-precision timestamps

Axiom applies the following data model transformations:
- Truncates nanosecond precision timestamps to the second.
- Flattens all tags into a single namespace without differentiating between resource, scope, and metrics tags.
- Converts `unit` to `otel.metric.unit`.
- Doesn’t preserve description, properties, and histogram width. Axiom assumes equal-width histograms.
