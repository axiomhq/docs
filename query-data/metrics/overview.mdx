Axiom’s dedicated MetricsDB provides a purpose-built metrics database that handles high-cardinality time-series data without the cost penalties and performance degradation common in traditional metrics systems. This section explains how to work with OpenTelemetry (OTel) metrics in Axiom.

<Info>
Support for OTel metrics is currently in private preview. For more information, see [Feature states](/platform-overview/roadmap#feature-states).

## What makes MetricsDB different

MetricsDB is engineered from the ground up to embrace dimensional complexity:

- **High-cardinality as a design principle**: Store metrics with high-cardinality dimensional tags: customer IDs, trace IDs, pod names, user agents, and other highly variable dimensions. Where other metrics databases penalize you with higher costs or degraded performance, MetricsDB treats high cardinality as a core capability.
- **Intentional architecture**: The storage format, query engine, and compression algorithms are specifically optimized for time-series metrics workloads. These design constraints are thoughtful trade-offs that deliver exceptional performance and cost-efficiency for real-world metrics use cases.
- **Unified observability**: Query metrics alongside logs and traces, enabling powerful correlations across all your telemetry data without switching tools or learning multiple query languages.

<Prerequisites />

<Note>
You must use a dedicated dataset for OTel metrics. When you create a dataset, select the type of OTel data you want to send to it. For more information, see [Create dataset](/reference/datasets#create-dataset).
</Note>

## Ingest metrics

You can ingest OTel metrics the same way you ingest logs and traces.

For more information, see [Send OpenTelemetry data to Axiom](/send-data/opentelemetry).

## Query metrics

You can query metric data using the Axiom Console. For more information, see [Query metrics](/query-data/metrics/query-metrics).

## Dashboards and monitors

You can use OTel metrics in dashboards and monitors the same way you use logs and traces.

- Build visualizations using metrics queries.
- Set alerts on derived metrics such as error rate or latency percentiles.
- Combine multiple signals in a single panel.

For more information, see [Dashboards](/dashboards/overview) and [Monitors](/monitor-data/monitors).

## Design choices and constraints

MetricsDB makes intentional architectural trade-offs to optimize for the most common metrics use cases while maintaining exceptional performance at scale.

### Query scope

You can query one dataset per query.

### Supported data types

MetricsDB focuses on the core OpenTelemetry metric types that cover the vast majority of observability scenarios.

Axiom doesn’t currently support the following data types:
- Exponential histograms
- `bytes`, `kvlist`, and `array` tag value types
- Exemplar, baggage, and context data
- Nanosecond-precision timestamps

### Data model optimizations

MetricsDB applies the following transformations to improve query performance and reduce storage costs:

- **Timestamp precision**: Truncate nanosecond timestamps to second precision. Second-level granularity is sufficient for metrics analysis (unlike traces which need finer resolution), and this optimization significantly improves compression ratios and query speed.
- **Unified tag namespace**: Flatten resource, scope, and metric tags into a single namespace. This simplification makes queries more straightforward and enables faster dimensional filtering. You don’t need to remember which tags came from which scope.
- **Unit normalization**: Convert the `unit` field to `otel.metric.unit` for consistent handling across all metric types.
- **Histogram handling**: Assume equal-width histograms and don’t preserve histogram metadata. This trade-off supports the most common histogram analysis patterns (percentiles, distribution visualization) while reducing storage requirements.

These design choices reflect real-world metrics usage patterns. If your use case requires capabilities not currently supported, [contact Axiom](https://axiom.co/contact) to discuss your requirements. Your feedback helps shape MetricsDB’s evolution.
