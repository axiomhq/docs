Dashboards provide a single pane of glass view into your data.

Axiom provides a mature dashboards experience that allows collections of queries across multiple datasets to be visualized in one place.

Dashboards are easy to share, benefit from collaboration, and bring separate datasets together in a single view.

This guide introduces the Dashboards tab and help you to create your first dashboard and add queries to it.

## Dashboards tab

Select a private or shared dashboard from this tab. A private dashboard is one that only you can see and edit, and a shared dashboard can be viewed or edited by anyone on your team.

1. Click **New Dashboard**, add a name and a description, and then click **Create**.

    <Frame caption="New dashboard dialog">
        <img src="/doc-assets/shots/dashboards-page-1.png" alt="New dashboard dialog" />
    </Frame>

    You see an empty dashboard.

2. Click **+ Add a chart** in the top right corner.

    </Frame>

3. Choose one of the following:

    - Click **Simple Query Builder** to create your chart using a visual query builder.

        </Frame>

    - Click **Advanced Query Language** to create your chart using the Axiom Processing Language (APL). For more information, see [Introduction to APL](/apl/introduction).

## Chart types

Chart types are the different visualizations that you can include in your dashboard to display your data. For example, you can track key metrics, logs, and traces, and monitor real-time data flow.

## Time series

Time series charts show the change in your data over time which can help identify infrastructure issues, spikes, or dips in the data. This can be a simple line chart, an area chart, or a bar chart. A time series chart might be used to show the change in the volume of log events, error rates, latency, or other time-sensitive data. Choose one of the following:

- Click **Simple Query Builder**.

  <img src="/doc-assets/shots/timeseries-simple-chart.png" />
</Frame>

- Click **Advanced Query Language**.

<Frame>

</Frame>

## Filter bar

For more information on filter bars, see [Create dashboards with filters](/query-data/filters).

## Log stream 

The log stream chart displays your logs as they come in real-time. Each log appears as a separate line with various details. The benefit of a Log Stream is that it provides immediate visibility into your system’s operations. When you’re debugging an issue or trying to understand an ongoing event, the Log Stream allows you to see exactly what’s happening as it occurs.

Choose one of the following:

- Click **Simple Query Builder**.

</Frame>

- Click **Advanced Query Language**.

  <img src="/doc-assets/shots/log-stream-chart-apl.png" />
</Frame>

## Scatter plot

Scatter plots are used to visualize the correlation or distribution between two distinct metrics or logs. Each point in the scatter plot could represent a log entry, with the X and Y axes showing different log attributes (like request time and response size). The scatter plot chart can be created using the simple query builder or advanced query builder.

Choose one of the following:

- Click **Simple Query Builder**.

</Frame>

- Click **Advanced Query Language**.

<Frame>
  <img src="/doc-assets/shots/scatter-chart-apl-2.png" />
</Frame>

For example, plot response size against response time for an API to see if larger responses are correlated with slower response times.

## Statistic

Statistics charts display a summary of the selected metrics over a given time period. For example, you can use a statistics chart to show the average, sum, min, max, and count of response times or error counts.

Choose one of the following:

- Click **Simple Query Builder**.

<Frame>
  <img src="/doc-assets/shots/simple-chart-statistic-1.png" />
</Frame>

- Click **Advanced Query Language**.

<Frame>
  <img src="/doc-assets/shots/apl-chart-statistic-2.png" />
</Frame>

## Table

The table chart displays a summary of any attributes from your metrics, logs, or traces in a sortable table format. Each row in the table could represent a different service, host, or other entity, with columns showing various attributes or metrics for that entity.

Choose one of the following:

- Click **Simple Query Builder**.

<Frame>
  <img src="/doc-assets/shots/table-chart-simple.png" />

- Click **Advanced Query Language**. With this option, the table chart type has the capability to display a non-aggregated view of events.

<Frame>

- To create your table chart using the **simple query builder**, click the simple query builder and enter the name of your chart, and select the table chart type.

## Chart Options

### Values

The values section determines how the data points on your chart are represented.

- Auto: This option automatically decides the best way to represent missing or undefined values in the data series based on the chart type and the rest of the data.

- Ignore: This option ignores any missing or undefined values in the data series. This means that the chart only displays the known, defined values.

- Join Adjacent Values: This option connects adjacent data points in the data series, effectively filling in any gaps caused by missing values. The benefit of joining adjacent values is that it can provide a smoother, more continuous visualization of your data.

- Fill with Zeros: This option replaces any missing or undefined values in the data series with zero. This can be useful if you want to emphasize that the data is missing or undefined, as it causes a drop to zero in your chart.

### Variant

The variant chart section determines the visual style of your chart.

- Area: An area chart displays the area between the data line and the axes, often filled with a color or pattern. Stacked charts provide the capability to design and implement intricate query dashboards while integrating advanced visualizations, enriching your logging experience over time.

- Bars: A bar chart represents data in rectangular bars. The length of each bar is proportional to the value it represents. Bar charts can be used to compare discrete quantities, or when you have categorical data.

- Line: A line chart connects individual data points into a continuous line, which is useful for showing logs over time. Line charts are often used for time series data.

### Y-Axis

The Y-axis section determines the scale used on the Y-axis of your chart.

- Linear: A linear scale maintains a consistent scale where equal distances represent equal changes in value. This is the most common scale type and is useful for most types of data.

</Frame>

- Log: A logarithmic (or log) scale represents values in terms of their order of magnitude. Each unit of distance on a log scale represents a tenfold increase in value. Log scales make it easy to see backend errors and compare values across a wide range.

When you are done building your dashboards, enter the **title**, **chart type** and **view** of your dashboard and click **validate & save**

Click the Done button when you are finished, and you now see your query in your dashboard. You can adjust the dimensions of the query from the bottom-right corner.

Click **Save Dashboard** to save your changes.

## Dashboard Settings

From the toolbar, you can:

- Add more queries
- Change ownership of the dashboard between yourself and a team
- Change the time range that all the queries in a dashboard display
- Full screen the dashboard, which is perfect for displaying it on a TV or shared monitor
