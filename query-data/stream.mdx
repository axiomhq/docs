The Stream tab allows you to inspect individual events and watch as they're ingested live.

It can be incredibly useful to be able to live-stream events as they're ingested to know what's going on in the context of the entire system. Like a supercharged terminal, the Stream tab in Axiom allows you to view streams of events, filter them to see only important information, and inspect each individual event.

This section introduces the Stream tab and its components that unlock powerful insights from your data.

## Choose a dataset

The default view shows available datasets and recent Starred Queries in case you want to jump directly into a stream:

<Frame caption="Datasets overview">
  <img src="/doc-assets/shots/choose-a-dataset-1.png" alt="Datasets overview" />
</Frame>

Select a dataset from the list to continue.

## Event stream

After selecting a dataset, you are immediately taken to the live event stream for that dataset:

<Frame caption="Event stream">
  <img src="/doc-assets/shots/event-stream-1.png" alt="Event stream" />
</Frame>

Click an event to open the event details slide-out:

<Frame caption="Event details">
  <img src="/doc-assets/shots/event-slideout-1.png" alt="Event details" />
</Frame>

In this slide-out, you can copy individual field values or copy the entire event as JSON.

You can view and copy the raw data:

  <img src="/doc-assets/shots/raw-data-1.png" alt="Event details" />
</Frame>

## Filter data

The Stream tab provides access to a powerful filter builder right on the toolbar:

</Frame>

For more information, see the [filters documentation](/dashboard-elements/create#filters).

## Time range selection

The stream has two time modes:

- Live stream (default)
- Time range

Live stream continuously checks for new events and presents them in the stream.

Time range shows only events that fall between a specific start and end date. This can be useful when investigating an issue. The time range menu has options to quickly choose time ranges, or you can input a specific range for your search:

  <img src="/doc-assets/shots/time-range-selection.gif" alt="Time range menu" />
</Frame>

When you are ready to return to live streaming, click this button:

<Frame caption="Return to Live button">
  <img src="/doc-assets/shots/stream-live-button.gif" alt="Return to Live button" />
</Frame>

Click the button again to pause the stream.

## View settings

The Stream tab is customizable through the view settings menu:

<Frame caption="View menu">
  <img src="/doc-assets/shots/view-settings-1.png" alt="View menu" />
</Frame>

Options include:

- Text size used in the stream
- Wrap lines
- Highlight severity (automatically extracted from the event)
- Show the raw event details
- Fields to display in their own column

## Starred queries

Access the starred queries slide-out through the toolbar:

<Frame caption="Starred queries">
  <img src="/doc-assets/shots/stream-starred.png" alt="Starred queries" />
</Frame>

For more information, see [Starred queries](/query-data/datasets#starred-queries).

## Highlight severity

The Stream tab enables you to process and inspect every log produced by your infrastructure, containers, and cloud environment. Highlighting severity allows you to track warning signs and detect errors from your resources and choose which logs to retain to maintain cost-efficiency.

In the settings view on the Stream tab, enabling **Highlight Severity** automatically searches for the words `warn` and `error` from the following keys: 

- `level`
- `severity`
- `@level`
- `@severity`
- `message`
- `msg`
- `@message`
- `text`

<Frame caption="Logging codes">
  <img src="/doc-assets/shots/highlight-severity-1.png" alt="Logging codes" />
</Frame>

The `warn` value is displayed in orange, and the `error` value is displayed in red.
