A flow is a way to filter, shape, and route data from an Axiom dataset to a destination that you choose. This page explains how to set up a flow.

- Set up a destination. For more information, see [Destinations](/process-data/destinations).

## Set up a flow

To set up a flow:
1. Click the [Flows](https://app.axiom.co/flows) tab. Axiom displays the list of flows you have created.
2. In the top right, click **New flow**.
3. In the **Source** section, specify the source dataset and the transformation in an APL query. For example, the following APL query selects events from a `cloudflare-logpush` dataset and reduces them by removing a set of fields before enriching with a new field.

    ```kusto
    ['cloudflare-logpush']
    | where QueryName == "app.axiom.co."
    // Reduce events by dropping unimportant field
    | project-away ['@app']*
    // Enrich events with additional context
    | extend ['@origin'] = "_axiom"
    ```

    <Note>
    If you specify only the name of the dataset in the query, Axiom routes all events to the destination.
    </Note>

4. Click **Preview** to check whether the query you specified transforms your data as desired. The **Input event** section displays the original data stored in Axiom. The **Output event** section displays the transformed data that Axiom sends to the destination. The original data in the Axiom dataset isn't affected by the transformation.
5. In the **Destinations** section, click **Add destination**, and then select the destination where you want to route data. To add several destinations, click **+** in the top right corner.
6. In the top right, click **Create**.

After creating a flow, you can choose from three flow types: one-time, scheduled, and continuous flows.

<Note>
    Flow is currently in preview, with support for one-time flows.
</Note>

### One-time flow

One-time flows route data to configured destinations when you manually initiate a replay.

To set up a replay:

1. Click the **Flows** tab. Axiom displays the list of flows you have created. Select the flow that you want to replay.
2. In the top right, click **Run replay**.
3. Specify the time range for events you want to replay.
4. Click **Replay flow**.

As a result, Axiom runs the query on the source data for the specified time range and then routes the results of the query to the destination.
