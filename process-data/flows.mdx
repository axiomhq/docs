A flow is a way to filter, shape, and route data from an Axiom dataset to a destination that you choose. This page explains how to set up a flow.

- Set up a destination. For more information, see [Destinations](/process-data/destinations).

## Set up a flow configuration

To set up a flow configuration:
1. Click the [Flows](https://app.axiom.co/flows) tab. Axiom displays the list of flow configurations you have created.
2. In the top right, click **New configuration**.
3. In the **Source** section, specify the source dataset and the transformation in an APL query. For example, the following APL query selects events from a `cloudflare-logpush` dataset and reduces them by removing a set of fields, before enriching with a new field.

    ```kusto
    ['cloudflare-logpush']
    | where QueryName == "app.axiom.co."
    // Reduce events by dropping unimportant field
    | project-away ['@app']*
    // Enrich events with additional context
    | extend ['@origin'] = "_axiom"
    ```

    <Note>
    If you only specify the name of the dataset in the query, Axiom routes all events to the destination.
    </Note>

4. Click **Preview** to check whether the query you specified transforms your data as desired. The **Input event** section displays the original data stored in Axiom. The **Output event** section displays the transformed data that Axiom sends to the destination. The original data in the Axiom dataset isnâ€™t affected by the transformation.
5. In the **Destination** section, click **Add a destination**, and then select the destination where you want to route data. 
6. In the top right, click **Create**.

After creating a flow, you can choose from three flow types: one-time, scheduled, and continuous flows.

<Note>
    Flow is currently in preview, with support for one-time flows.
</Note>

### One-time flow

One-time flows allow you to process past data within a chosen time range, and immediately route the output to your destination.

To create up a one-time flow:

1. Click the **Flows** tab. Axiom displays the list of flow conigurations you have created. Select the flow configuration that you want to use for creating a one-time flow.
2. In the top right, click **Create flow** and select **One-time flow**.
3. Specify the time range for events you want to process.
4. Click **Create flow**.

As a result, Axiom runs the query on the source data for the specified time range, and then routes the results of the query to the destination.
