A flow is a way to filter, shape, and route data from an Axiom dataset to a destination that you choose. This page explains how to set up a flow.

- Set up a destination. For more information, see [Destinations](/process-data/destinations).

## Set up a flow configuration

To set up a flow configuration:
1. Click the [Flows](https://app.axiom.co/flows) tab. Axiom displays the list of flow configurations you have created.
1. In the top right, click **New configuration**.
1. In the **Source** section, specify the source dataset and the transformation in an APL query. For example, the following APL query selects events from a `cloudflare-logpush` dataset and reduces them by removing a set of fields, before enriching with a new field.

    ```kusto
    ['cloudflare-logpush']
    | where QueryName == "app.axiom.co."
    // Reduce events by dropping unimportant field
    | project-away ['@app']*
    // Enrich events with additional context
    | extend ['@origin'] = "_axiom"
    ```

    <Note>
    If you only specify the name of the dataset in the query, Axiom routes all events to the destination.
    </Note>

1. Click **Preview** to check whether the query you specified transforms your data as desired. The **Input event** section displays the original data stored in Axiom. The **Output event** section displays the transformed data that Axiom sends to the destination. The original data in the Axiom dataset isnâ€™t affected by the transformation.
1. In the **Destination** section, click **Add a destination**, and then select an existing destination where you want to route data or click **Create new destination**.
1. In the top right, click **Create**.

After creating a flow configuration, create a flow by selecting one of the following:
- **Continuous flow**
- **One-time flow**

## Create continuous flow

Continuous flows are continuously running operations that process your incoming data and route the outputs to a destination in real-time.

1. Click the **Flows** tab. Axiom displays the list of flow configurations you have created. Select the flow configuration that you want to use for creating a continuous flow.
1. In the top right, click **Create flow** and select **Continuous flow**.
1. Click **Create flow**.

As a result, Axiom starts running the query on all incoming data and routes the results of the query to the destination.

## Create one-time flow

One-time flows are one-off operations that process past data for a specific time range and route the output to a destination.

1. Click the **Flows** tab. Axiom displays the list of flow configurations you have created. Select the flow configuration that you want to use for creating a one-time flow.
1. In the top right, click **Create flow** and select **One-time flow**.
1. Specify the time range for events you want to process.
1. Click **Create flow**.

As a result, Axiom runs the query on the source data for the specified time range and routes the results of the query to the destination.

### Delivery rate of continuous flows

The delivery rate of a continuous flow currently depends on the rate at which you ingest data into the source dataset. For example, if you set up a continuous flow and ingest data at a rate of 1TB/day to the source dataset, Axiom processes events within a few seconds after ingest. If you ingest data to the source at a rate of 10GB/day, it can take several minutes for events to arrive. There is currently no maximum wait time for events to be processed by a continuous flow. As Flow progresses through the preview stage, Axiom will establish and refine maximum wait times.
