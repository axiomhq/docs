description: 'This section explains how to use Axiom’s Flow feature to filter, shape, and route event data.'

Flow provides onward event processing, including filtering, shaping, and routing. Flow works after persisting data in Axiom’s highly efficient queryable store, and uses [APL](/apl/introduction) to define processing.

    Flow is currently in preview. To try it out, [sign up for a free account](https://app.axiom.co/flows).

## Elements of a flow

A flow consists of three elements:
- **Source**. This is the Axiom dataset used as the flow origin.
- **Transformation**. This is the APL query used to filter, shape, and enrich the events.
- **Destination**. This is where events are routed.

## Flow types

There are three types of flows:
- **One-time flows** route data to the destination once when you manually initiate a replay.
- **Scheduled flows** route data to the destination once at a scheduled time.
- **Continuous flows** route data to the destination on a rolling basis, when Axiom receives new events that match your APL query.

<Note>
    Flow is currently in preview, with support for one-time flows.
