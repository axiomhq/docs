Flow provides onward event processing, including filtering, shaping, and routing. Flow works after persisting data in Axiom’s highly efficient queryable store, and uses [APL](/apl/introduction) to define processing.

## Elements of a flow

A flow consists of three elements:
- **Source**. This is the Axiom dataset used as the flow origin.
- **Transformation**. This is the APL query used to filter, shape, and enrich the events.
- **Destination**. This is where events are routed.

To get started with Flow, see [Configure Flow](/process-data/flows).
