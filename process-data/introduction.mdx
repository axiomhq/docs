Flow provides onward event processing, including filtering, shaping, and routing. Flow works after persisting data in Axiom's highly efficient queryable store, and uses [APL](/apl/introduction) to define processing.

    Flow is currently in preview. To try it out, [sign up for a free account](https://app.axiom.co/flows).

## Elements of a flow

A flow consists of three elements:
- **Source**: This is the Axiom dataset used as the flow origin
- **Transformation**: This is the APL query used to filter, shape, and enrich the events
- **Destination**: This is where events are routed

## Flow types

There are three types of flows:
- **One-time flows** route data to the destination once when you manually initiate a replay
- **Scheduled flows** route data to the destination once at a scheduled time
- **Continuous flows** route data to the destination on a rolling basis, when Axiom receives new events that match your APL query

<Note>
    Flow is currently in preview, with support for one-time flows.
