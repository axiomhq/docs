A flow is a way to transfer and transform data from an Axiom dataset to a destination that you choose. For example, you can use flows to retain the complete record of all events in Axiom while transferring high-value app events to a costly SIEM.

The **Flows** tab allows you to move and transform data using APL and provides you with a unified experience that streamlines your data workflows.

## Elements of a flow

A flow consists of three elements:
- **Source**. This is the Axiom dataset from which you transfer and transform data.
- **Transformation**. This is the APL query you use to shape your data.
- **Destination**. This is where you transfer the data.

After creating a flow, replay it for a specified time range to transfer the matching and transformed data to the destination. There are three types of flows:
- One-time flows transfer data to the destination once when you manually initiate the replay.
- Scheduled flows transfer data to the destination once at a scheduled time.
- Continuous flows transfer data to the destination on a rolling basis, when Axiom receives new events that match your APL query.

The preview only supports one-time flows.
