Flow provides onward event processing, including filtering, shaping, and routing. Flow works after persisting data in Axiom’s highly efficient queryable store, and uses [APL](/apl/introduction) to define processing.

## Elements of a flow

A flow consists of three elements:
- **Source**. This is the Axiom dataset used as the flow origin.
- **Transformation**. This is the APL query used to filter, shape, and enrich the events.
- **Destination**. This is where events are routed.

## Flow types

There are three types of flows:
- **One-time flows** allow you to process past data within a chosen time range, and immediately route the output to your destination.
- **Scheduled flows** allow you to process past data on a given schedule, and periodically route the outputs to your destination.
- **Continuous flows** allow you to continuously process your incoming data, and route outputs in real time to your destination.

<Note>
    Flow is currently in preview, with support for one-time flows.
