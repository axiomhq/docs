Flow provides onward event processing, including filtering, shaping, and routing. Flow works after persisting data in Axiom’s highly efficient queryable store, and uses [APL](/apl/introduction) to define processing.

## Elements of a flow

A flow consists of three elements:
- **Source**. This is the Axiom dataset used as the flow origin.
- **Transformation**. This is the APL query used to filter, shape, and enrich the events.
- **Destination**. This is where events are routed.

## Flow types

There are three types of flows:
- **One-time flows** are one-off operations that process past data for a specific time range and route the output to a destination.
- **Scheduled flows** are repeated operations that process past data on a specific schedule and periodically route the outputs to a destination.
- **Continuous flows** are continuously running operations that process your incoming data and route the outputs to a destination in real-time.

<Note>
    Flow is currently in preview, with support for one-time and continuous flows.
