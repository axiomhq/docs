Flow provides onward event processing, including filtering, shaping, and routing. Flow works after persisting data in Axiom’s highly efficient queryable store, and uses [APL](/apl/introduction) to define processing.

    Flow is currently in private preview. To try it out, [sign up for a free account](https://app.axiom.co/flows).

## Elements of a flow

A flow consists of three elements:
- **Source**. This is the Axiom dataset used as the flow origin.
- **Transformation**. This is the APL query used to filter, shape, and enrich the events.
- **Destination**. This is where events are routed.

## Flow types

There is currently one type of flows:
- **One-time flows** are one-off operations that process past data for a specific time range and route the output to a destination.

<Note>
    Flow is currently in private preview, with support for one-time flows only.
