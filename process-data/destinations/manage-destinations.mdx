To transform and route data from an Axiom dataset to a destination, you need to set up a destination. This is where data is routed. Once you set up a destination, it can be used in any flow.

To set up a destination:
1. Click the [Flows](https://app.axiom.co/flows) tab. Axiom displays the list of flows you have created.
2. In the top right, click **Manage destinations**, and then click **New destination**.
3. Name the destination.
4. In **Kind**, select the destination type.
5. Configure the destination. For more information on each destination type, see the following:

    - [Axiom](/process-data/destinations/axiom)
    - [Amazon S3](/process-data/destinations/amazon-s3)
    - [Azure Blob](/process-data/destinations/azure-blob)
    - [Elastic Bulk](/process-data/destinations/elastic-bulk)
    - [HTTP](/process-data/destinations/http#configure-http-destination)
    - [HTTP (Authorization)](/process-data/destinations/http#configure-http-authorization-destination)
    - [HTTP (Basic)](/process-data/destinations/http#configure-http-basic-destination)
    - [OpenTelemetry Traces](/process-data/destinations/opentelemetry#configure-opentelemetry-traces-destination)

6. At the bottom right, click **Save**.
