To transform and route data from an Axiom dataset to a destination, you need to set up a destination. This is where data is routed. Once you set up a destination, it can be used in any flow configuration.

To set up a destination:
1. Click the [Flows](https://app.axiom.co/flows) tab. Axiom displays the list of flow configurations you have created.
1. In the left, click **Destinations**, and then click **New destination**.
1. Name the destination.
1. In **Destination type**, select the destination type.
1. Configure the destination. For more information on each destination type, see the following:
