1. In Elastic, ensure your account has the index privileges to use the create action. For more information, see the [Elastic documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html#docs-bulk-api-prereqs).
2. In Axiom, configure the following:
    - In **URL**, enter the path to the Elastic Bulk API where you want to transfer data. For example, enter `https://api.elastic-cloud.com/` if you use Elastic Cloud.
    - In **Index**, enter the Elastic index.
    - In **Username** and **Password**, enter your Elastic login credentials.
