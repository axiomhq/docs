To set up an Elastic Bulk destination:

1. In Elastic, ensure your account has the index privileges to use the create action. For more information, see the [Elastic documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html#docs-bulk-api-prereqs).
2. In Axiom, create an Elastic Bulk destination. For more information, see [Manage destinations](/process-data/destinations/manage-destinations.mdx).
3. Configure the following:
    - In **URL**, enter the path to the Elastic Bulk API where you want to route data. For example, enter `https://api.elastic-cloud.com/` if you use Elastic Cloud.
    - In **Index**, enter the Elastic index.
    - In **Username** and **Password**, enter your Elastic login credentials.
