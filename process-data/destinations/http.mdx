To configure an HTTP destination:

- In **URL**, enter the path to the HTTP destination where you want to route data.
- Optional: In **Format**, specify the format in which Axiom sends data to the destination.
- Optional: In **Headers**, specify any headers you want Axiom to send to the destination.
- In **Authorization type**, select one of the following options to authorize requests to the HTTP destination:
    - Select **None** if the destination doesnâ€™t require authorization to receive data.
    - Select **Authorization header** to authorize requests to the destination with the `Authorization` request header, and specify the value of the request header. For example, `Basic 123`. For more information, see the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization).
    - Select **Basic** to authorize requests to the destination with username and password, and specify your login credentials.
