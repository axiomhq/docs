1. Create credentials for the service account in JSON format. For more information, see the [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#create_credentials_for_a_service_account).
1. In Axiom, create a Google Cloud Storage destination. For more information, see [Manage destinations](/process-data/destinations/manage-destinations).
1. Configure the following:
    - In **Bucket**, enter the bucket name. For more information on retrieving bucket metadata in Google Cloud Storage, see the [Google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/getting-bucket-metadata).

    - Optional: In **Format**, specify the format in which Axiom sends data to the destination.
