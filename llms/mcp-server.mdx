Axiom MCP Server is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server implementation that enables AI agents to query your data using Axiom Processing Language (APL).

## Current capabilities

Axiom MCP Server supports the following MCP [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools):

- `queryApl`: Execute APL queries against Axiom datasets
- `listDatasets`: List available Axiom datasets
- `getDatasetSchema`: Get dataset schema
- `getSavedQueries`: Retrieve saved APL queries
- `getMonitors`: List monitoring configurations
- `getMonitorsHistory`: Get monitor execution history

Axiom MCP Server also supports the following [prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts):

- `explore-unknown-dataset`: Exploration of an unknown dataset to understand its structure, content, and potential use cases
- `detect-anomalies-in-events`: Generic anomaly detection using statistical analysis and pattern recognition across any dataset
- `correlate-events-across-datasets`: Find patterns and correlations between events across multiple datasets
- `monitor-health-analysis`: Comprehensive analysis of monitor health, alert patterns, and effectiveness
- `data-quality-investigation`: Investigate data quality issues including missing data, inconsistencies, and collection problems
- `establish-performance-baseline`: Establish performance baselines for a dataset to enable effective monitoring and anomaly detection

Axiom MCP Server works with all AI agents that support MCP. This page gives examples about setting up the Axiom MCP Server with the [Claude desktop app](https://claude.ai/download).

<Prerequisites />
- Set up an AI agent that supports MCP. For example, install the [Claude desktop app](https://claude.ai/download).

## Install 

Using the MCP client, choose the option to add a remote MCP connection and provide the following details:
- Name: Axiom
- URL: https://mcp.axiom.co/mcp

For example, if using the Claude client and if you have a Pro or Team account with sufficient privileges, go to Settings > Connectors.

If using the Claude client and you do not have the option to add a Connector, add `axiom` to the `mcpServers` section of the Claude configuration file. If you use a Mac, the default path is `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.

    ```json claude_desktop_config.json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "axiom": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args" : ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.axiom.co/mcp"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Authenticate

When your client first attempts to interact with the Axiom MCP server, your default browser will bring you to the Axiom login page to authenticate using OAuth 2.0. Authenticate to provide access. The client will only have access to the tools listed above.

If you wish to revoke access, you can view and revoke active sessions at your Profile page in the Axiom Console.

## Ask your AI agent about your data

Ask your AI agent questions about your Axiom data. For example:

- “List datasets.”
- “Get the data schema for the dataset `logs`.”
- “Get the most common status codes in the last 30 minutes in the dataset `logs`.”

For more information about the types of questions the Axiom MCP Server can help you answer, see [Current capabilities](#current-capabilities).
