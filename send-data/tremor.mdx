Axiom provides a unique way of ingesting [Tremor logs](https://www.tremor.rs/) into Axiom. With your connector definitions, you can configure Tremor connectors and events components to interact with your external systems, such as databases, message queues, or APIs, and eventually ingest data from these sources into Axiom.

## Installation 

To install tremor grab the latest package from the runtime [releases tag](https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/releases), and install it on your local machine.

## Configuration using HTTP

To send logs via Tremor to Axiom, you need to create a configuration file. For example, create `axiom-http.troy` with the following content (using a file as example data source):

```troy
define flow client_sink_only
flow
  use std::time::nanos;
  use tremor::pipelines;

  define connector input from file
  args
    file = "in.json"  # Default input file is 'in.json' in current working directory
  with
    codec = "json",   # Data is JSON encoded
    preprocessors = ["separate"],   # Data is newline separated
    config = {
        "path": args.file,
        "mode": "read"
    },
  end;
  create connector input;

  define connector http_client from http_client
  args
    dataset,
    token
  with
    config = {
      "url": "https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/#{args.dataset}/ingest",
      "tls": true,
      "method": "POST",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer #{args.token}"
      },
      "timeout": nanos::from_seconds(10),
      "mime_mapping": {
        "*/*": {"name": "json"}, 
      } 
    }
  end;
  create connector http_client
  with
    dataset = "$DATASET_NAME",
    token = "$API_TOKEN"
  end;

  create pipeline passthrough from pipelines::passthrough;

  connect /connector/input to /pipeline/passthrough;
  connect /pipeline/passthrough to /connector/http_client;

end;

deploy flow client_sink_only;
```

This assumes you have set `TREMOR_PATH` in your environment pointing to `tremor-runtime/tremor-script/lib` if you are using a `src` clone then you can execute it as follows `tremor server run axiom-http.troy`

The`$DATASET_NAME` [dataset](/reference/datasets) you want to send logs to in Axiom, and the `$API_TOKEN` is your [Axiom API token](/reference/tokens) for ingesting and quering your Tremor logs.

## Configuration using Syslog

You can also send logs via Tremor to the Syslog endpoint using a file as an example data source.

import SetUpEndpoint from "/snippets/set-up-endpoint-no-heading.mdx"

<SetUpEndpoint endpointName="Syslog" />

In the code below, replace `url` with the URL of your Syslog endpoint.

```troy
define flow client_sink_only
flow
  use std::time::nanos;
  use tremor::pipelines;

  define connector input from file
  args
    file = "in.json"  # Default input file is 'in.json' in current working directory
  with
    codec = "json",    # Data is JSON encoded
    preprocessors = ["separate"],    # Data is newline separated
    config = {
        "path": args.file,
        "mode": "read"
    },
  end;
  create connector input;

define connector syslog_forwarder from tcp_client
args
  endpoint_hostport,
with
    tls = true,
    codec = "syslog",
    config = {
      "url": "#{args.endpoint_hostport}",
      "no_delay": false,
      "buf_size": 1024,
    },
    reconnect = {
      "retry": {
        "interval_ms": 100,
        "growth_rate": 2,
        "max_retries": 3,
      }
    }
 end;
  create connector syslog_forwarder 
  with
    endpoint_hostport = "tcp+tls://testsyslog.syslog.axiom.co:6514"
  end;

  create pipeline passthrough from pipelines::passthrough;

  connect /connector/input to /pipeline/passthrough;
  connect /pipeline/passthrough to /connector/syslog_forwarder;

end;

deploy flow client_sink_only;
```
