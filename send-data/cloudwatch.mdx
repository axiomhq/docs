## Prerequisites

- Create an account on [AWS Cloud](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start/email)
- Sign up or log in to your [account on Axiom](https://app.axiom.co/login?return_to=%2F)
- On Axiom UI, create a [dataset](/reference/datasets) and [API token](/reference/tokens) with ingest permissions for that dataset

## Installation

Axiom CloudWatch integration is available and [opensource on GitHub](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-cloudwatch-lambda).

1. [Launch the Stack](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/create/template?stackName=CloudWatch-Axiom&templateURL=https://axiom-cloudformation-stacks.s3.amazonaws.com/axiom-cloudwatch-lambda-cloudformation-stack.yaml) and enter your stack details:

- Name of your Axiom dataset
- Enter the value of your Axiom API token
- Value of your `CloudWatchLogGroupName` and `Data Tags`

- Click **Next** and create your stack.

## Configuration

- Enter your log group name
- Set your retention setting
- Specify your key tags on your existing AWS resources

## Subscribe to more LogGroups

1. You can subscribe to more LogGroups by [launching the Stack](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/create?stackName=CloudWatch-Backfiller-Axiom&templateURL=https://axiom-cloudformation-stacks.s3.amazonaws.com/axiom-cloudwatch-backfiller-lambda-cloudformation-stack.yaml). This spawns a one-time lambda to create multiple subscription filters with the `lambda ARN` as destination.

- The template is uploaded to S3.

- Click **Create**.

- With this you can send and get the logs from multiple CloudWatch log groups directly to Axiom.

2. Back in the Axiom UI, you can see your logs directly from your CloudWatch LogGroups.
