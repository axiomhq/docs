Axiom CloudWatch Forwarder is a set of easy-to-use AWS CloudFormation stacks designed to forward logs from Amazon CloudWatch to Axiom. It includes a Lambda function to handle the forwarding and stacks to create Amazon CloudWatch log group subscription filters for both existing and future log groups.

## Understanding the modules

Axiom CloudWatch Forwarder includes templates for the following CloudFormation stacks:

- **Forwarder** creates a Lambda function that forwards logs from Amazon CloudWatch to Axiom. This is the core component that runs continuously and processes log events.
- **Subscriber** subscribes existing log groups to the Forwarder. It runs once at deployment time (`terraform apply` or CloudFormation stack creation) and creates subscription filters for log groups specified by a combination of names, prefix, and regular expression filters.
- **Listener** automatically subscribes new log groups created after deployment. It runs continuously via Amazon EventBridge and creates subscription filters for future log groups matching your filters. This way, you don't have to manually subscribe new log groups.
- **Unsubscriber** removes subscription filters from log groups. It runs once at deployment time and is used for cleanup.

<Tip>
**Why you need both Subscriber and Listener:** The Subscriber only handles log groups that exist at deployment time. The Listener handles log groups created after deployment. For complete coverage of both existing and future log groups, use both modules together.
</Tip>

## Which modules do you need?

| Scenario | Modules needed |
|----------|----------------|
| Forward logs from existing log groups only | Forwarder + Subscriber |
| Forward logs from future log groups only | Forwarder + Listener |
| Forward logs from both existing and future log groups | Forwarder + Subscriber + Listener |
| Stop forwarding logs from specific log groups | Unsubscriber |

<Note>
    The Axiom CloudWatch Forwarder is an open-source project and welcomes your contributions. For more information, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-cloudwatch-forwarder).
</Note>

<Prerequisites />
- [Create an account on AWS Cloud](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register).

## Installation

To install the Axiom CloudWatch Forwarder, choose one of the following:

- [Cloudformation stacks](#install-with-cloudformation-stacks)
- [Terraform module](#install-with-terraform-module)

### Install with Cloudformation stacks

1. [Launch the Forwarder stack template on AWS](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/new?stackName=axiom-cloudwatch-forwarder&templateURL=https://axiom-cloudformation.s3.amazonaws.com/stacks/axiom-cloudwatch-forwarder-v1.1.1-cloudformation-stack.yaml). Copy the Forwarder Lambda ARN because it’s referenced in the Subscriber stack.
1. [Launch the Subscriber stack template on AWS](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/new?stackName=axiom-cloudwatch-subscriber&templateURL=https://axiom-cloudformation.s3.amazonaws.com/stacks/axiom-cloudwatch-subscriber-v1.1.1-cloudformation-stack.yaml).
1. [Launch the Listener stack template on AWS](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/new?stackName=axiom-cloudwatch-listener&templateURL=https://axiom-cloudformation.s3.amazonaws.com/stacks/axiom-cloudwatch-listener-v1.1.1-cloudformation-stack.yaml).

### Install with Terraform module

<Steps>
<Step>

Create a new Forwarder module in your Terraform file. This is the core component that sends logs to Axiom:

```hcl
# Required: Creates the Lambda function that forwards logs to Axiom
module "forwarder" {
  source        = "axiomhq/axiom-cloudwatch-forwarder/aws//modules/forwarder"
  axiom_dataset = "DATASET_NAME"
  axiom_token   = "API_TOKEN"
}
```

<Info>
<ReplaceDatasetToken />
</Info>

Alternatively, create a dataset with the [Axiom Terraform provider](/apps/terraform#create-dataset).

</Step>
<Step>

Create a new Subscriber module to subscribe existing log groups. This runs once at `terraform apply`:

``` hcl
# Subscribes existing log groups matching the prefix (runs once)
module "subscriber" {
  source               = "axiomhq/axiom-cloudwatch-forwarder/aws//modules/subscriber"
  forwarder_lambda_arn = module.forwarder.lambda_arn
  log_groups_prefix    = "/aws/lambda/"  # Change to your prefix
}
```

</Step>
<Step>

Create a new Listener module to automatically subscribe future log groups. This runs continuously via EventBridge:

```hcl
# Auto-subscribes new log groups matching the prefix (runs continuously)
module "listener" {
  source               = "axiomhq/axiom-cloudwatch-forwarder/aws//modules/listener"
  forwarder_lambda_arn = module.forwarder.lambda_arn
  log_groups_prefix    = "/aws/lambda/"  # Use the same prefix as Subscriber
}
```

<Note>
Use the same `log_groups_prefix` value in both Subscriber and Listener to ensure consistent coverage for existing and future log groups.
</Note>

</Step>
<Step>
In your terminal, go to the folder of your main Terraform file, and then run `terraform init`.
</Step>
<Step>
Run `terraform plan` to check the changes, and then run `terraform apply`.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Filter Amazon CloudWatch log groups

The Subscriber, Listener, and Unsubscriber modules allow you to filter which log groups to subscribe using three methods:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `log_groups_prefix` | Subscribe log groups starting with this prefix | `/aws/lambda/my-app-` |
| `log_groups_names` | Subscribe specific log groups (comma-separated) | `/aws/lambda/func1,/aws/lambda/func2` |
| `log_groups_pattern` | Subscribe log groups matching a regex pattern | `.*production.*` |

These filters are additive, meaning the union of all provided inputs is matched. If no filters are specified, all log groups are subscribed.

### Example

For example, you have the following list of log groups:

```
/aws/lambda/function-foo
/aws/lambda/function-bar
/aws/eks/cluster/cluster-1
/aws/rds/instance-baz
```

- To subscribe to the Lambda log groups exclusively, use a prefix filter with the value of `/aws/lambda`.
- To subscribe to EKS and RDS log groups, use a list of names with the value of `/aws/eks/cluster/cluster-1,/aws/rds/instance-baz`.
- To subscribe to the EKS log group and all Lambda log groups, use a combination of prefix and names list.
- To use the regular expression filter, write a regular expression to match the log group names. For example, `\/aws\/lambda\/.*` matches all Lambda log groups.
- To subscribe to all log groups, leave the filters empty.

## Listener architecture

The optional Listener stack does the following:

- Creates an Amazon S3 bucket for AWS CloudTrail.
- Creates a trail to capture the creation of new log groups.
- Creates an event rule to pass those creation events to an Amazon EventBridge event bus.
- Sends an event via EventBridge to a Lambda function when a new log group is created.
- Creates a subscription filter for each new log group.

## Remove subscription filters

To remove subscription filters for one or more log groups, [launch the Unsubscriber stack template on AWS](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/new?stackName=axiom-cloudwatch-subscriber&templateURL=https://axiom-cloudformation.s3.amazonaws.com/stacks/axiom-cloudwatch-unsubscriber-v1.1.1-cloudformation-stack.yaml).

The log group filtering works the same way as the Subscriber stack. You can filter the log groups by a combination of names, prefix, and regular expression filters.

Alternatively, to turn off log forwarding to Axiom, create a new Unsubscriber module in your Terraform file in the following way:

```hcl
module "unsubscriber" {
  source           = "axiomhq/axiom-cloudwatch-forwarder/aws//modules/unsubscriber"
  prefix           = "axiom-cloudwatch-forwarder"
  forwarder_lambda_arn = module.forwarder.lambda_arn
  log_groups_prefix    = "/aws/lambda/"
}
```
