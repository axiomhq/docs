Convex lets you manage the backend of your app (database, server, and more) from a centralized cloud interface. Set up a log stream in Convex to send your appâ€™s logs to Axiom and make it your single source of truth about events.

- [Create a Convex account](https://www.convex.dev/login).
- Set up your app with Convex. For example, follow one of the quickstart guides in the [Convex documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstarts).

## Configure Convex log streams

To send data from Convex to Axiom, set up a Convex log stream using the [Convex documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/production/integrations/log-streams#axiom). During this process, you need the following:

- The name of the Axiom dataset where you want to send data.
- The Axiom API token you have generated.
- Optional: A list of key-value pairs to include in all events your app sends to Axiom.
