[Convex](https://convex.dev) lets you manage the backend of your app (database, server, and more) from a centralized cloud interface. Set up a log stream in Convex to send your app’s logs to Axiom and make it your single source of truth about events.

<Prerequisites />
- [Create a Convex account](https://www.convex.dev/login) with a Professional plan.
- Set up your app with Convex. For example, follow one of the quickstart guides in the [Convex documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstarts).

## Configure Convex log streams

To send data from Convex to Axiom, set up a Convex log stream:

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure Axiom integration in Convex">
In your Convex dashboard, configure the Axiom integration. For more information, see the [Convex documentation about configuring an integration](https://docs.convex.dev/production/integrations/#configuring-an-integration).

During this process, you need the following:

- **Dataset name**: The name of the Axiom dataset where you want to send data.
- **API key**: Your Axiom API token.
- **Attributes** (optional): A list of key-value pairs to include in all events your app sends to Axiom. Attributes are useful for adding context like project name, environment, or team information to all your logs.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify connection">
Convex verifies the connection to Axiom and displays a confirmation when the log stream is active.
</Step>
</Steps>

For more information, see the [Convex documentation about log streams](https://docs.convex.dev/production/integrations/log-streams#axiom).

## Benefits of streaming Convex logs to Axiom

The Convex log streaming integration with Axiom provides several key benefits:

- **Complete observability**: Monitor all function executions, errors, and performance metrics in one place
- **Historical analysis**: Store and analyze logs beyond Convex’s recent logs view
- **Advanced querying**: Use APL to create complex queries and aggregations
- **Real-time monitoring**: Set up alerts and monitors for proactive issue detection
- **Custom dashboards**: Build tailored visualizations for your specific use cases
- **Team collaboration**: Share insights and dashboards with your development team
