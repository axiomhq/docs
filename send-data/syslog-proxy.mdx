The Axiom Syslog Proxy acts as a syslog server to send data to Axiom.

<Note>
    The Axiom Syslog Proxy is an open-source project and welcomes your contributions. For more information, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-syslog-proxy).
</Note>

## Syslog limitations and recommended alternatives

Syslog is an outdated protocol from the 1980s. Some of the limitations are the following:

- Lack of error reporting and feedback mechanisms when issues occur.
- Inability to gracefully terminate the connection. This can result in missing data.

<Note>
For a more reliable and modern logging experience, consider using tools like [Vector](https://vector.dev/) to receive syslog messages and [forward them to Axiom](/send-data/vector). This approach bypasses many of syslog’s limitations.
</Note>

<Prerequisites />

Other requirements:

- **Message size limit:** Axiom currently enforces a 64KB per-message size limit. This is in line with RFC5425 guidelines. Any message exceeding the limit causes the connection to close because Axiom doesn’t support ingesting truncated messages.
- **TLS requirement:** Axiom only supports syslog over TLS, specifically following RFC5425. Configure your syslog client accordingly.
- **Port requirements:** UDP log messages are sent on UDP port `514` to the Syslog server. TCP log messages are sent on TCP port `601` to the Syslog server.

Ensure your messages conform to the size limit and TLS requirements. If the connection is frequently re-established and messages are rejected, the issue can be the size of the messages or other formatting issues.

## Configure Axiom Syslog Proxy

Set the following environment variables to connect to Axiom:

- `AXIOM_TOKEN` is the Axiom API token you have generated.
- `AXIOM_DATASET` is the name of the Axiom dataset where you want to send data.

## Run Axiom Syslog Proxy

To run Axiom Syslog Proxy, run the following in your terminal.

```shell
./axiom-syslog-proxy
```

If you use Docker, run the following:

```shell
docker run -p601:601/tcp -p514:514/udp  \
  -e=AXIOM_TOKEN=API_TOKEN     \
  -e=AXIOM_DATASET=DATASET_NAME \
  axiomhq/axiom-syslog-proxy
```

<ReplaceDatasetToken />

## Test configuration

To test that the Axiom Syslog Proxy configuration:

1. Run the following in your terminal to send two messages:

    ```shell
    echo -n "tcp message" | nc -w1 localhost 601
    echo -n "udp message" | nc -u -w1 localhost 514
    ```

1. In Axiom, click the **Stream** tab.
1. Click your dataset.
1. Check whether Axiom displays the messages you have sent.
