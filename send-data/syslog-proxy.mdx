Logs are generated on all Network devices, Axiom Syslog Proxy ships logs to Axiom, acting as a Syslog server.

With Syslog logging system, you can monitor events on your devices and send them directly into Axiom, this also helps you retain your data logs.

The UDP log messages are sent on `UDP` port `514` to the Syslog server.

The TCP log messages are sent on `TCP` port `601` to the Syslog server.
