## What’s AWS FireLens?

AWS FireLens is a log routing feature for Amazon ECS. It lets you use popular open-source logging projects [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) or [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/) with Amazon ECS to route your logs to various AWS and partner monitoring solutions like Axiom without installing third-party agents on your tasks.

FireLens integrates with your Amazon ECS tasks and services seamlessly, so you can send logs from your containers to Axiom seamlessly.

## Use AWS FireLens with Fluent Bit and Axiom

Here’s a basic configuration for using FireLens with Fluent Bit to forward logs to Axiom:

## Fluent Bit configuration for Axiom 

You'll typically define this in a file called `fluent-bit.conf`:

```ini
[SERVICE]
    Log_Level info

[INPUT]
    Name forward
    Listen 0.0.0.0
    Port 24224

[OUTPUT]
    Name http
    Match *
    Host api.axiom.co
    Port 443
    URI /v1/datasets/$DATASET_NAME/ingest
    Format json_lines
    tls On
    format json
    json_date_key _time
    json_date_format iso8601
    # Authorization Bearer should be an API token
    Header Authorization Bearer xait-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx
```

## ECS task definition with FireLens

You'll want to include this within your ECS task definition, and reference the FireLens configuration type and options:

```json
{
  "family": "myTaskDefinition",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "log_router",
      "image": "amazon/aws-for-fluent-bit:latest",
      "essential": true,
      "firelensConfiguration": {
        "type": "fluentbit",
        "options": {
          "config-file-type": "file",
          "config-file-value": "/fluent-bit/etc/fluent-bit.conf"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "myApp",
      "image": "my-app-image",
      "logConfiguration": {
        "logDriver": "awsfirelens"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Use AWS FireLens with Fluentd and Axiom

Create the `fluentd.conf` file and add your configuration:

```bash
<source>
  @type forward
  port 24224
  bind 0.0.0.0
</source>

<match *>
  @type http
  # Authorization Bearer should be an ingest token
  headers {"Authorization": "Bearer <your-token>"}
  data_type json
  endpoint https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/$DATASET_NAME/ingest
  sourcetype ecs
</match>
```

## ECS Task Definition for Fluentd

The task definition would be similar to the Fluent Bit example, but using Fluentd and its configuration:

```json
{
  "family": "fluentdTaskDefinition",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "log_router",
      "image": "YOUR_ECR_REPO_URI:latest", 
      "essential": true,
      "memory": 512,
      "cpu": 256,
      "firelensConfiguration": {
        "type": "fluentd",
        "options": {
          "config-file-type": "file",
          "config-file-value": "/path/to/your/fluentd.conf"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "myApp",
      "image": "my-app-image",
      "essential": true,
      "memory": 512,
      "cpu": 256,
      "logConfiguration": {
        "logDriver": "awsfirelens",
        "options": {
          "Name": "forward",
          "Host": "log_router",
          "Port": "24224"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

By efficiently routing logs with FireLens and analyzing them with Axiom, businesses and development teams can save on operational overheads and reduce time spent on troubleshooting.
