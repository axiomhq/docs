import Prerequisites from "/snippets/standard-prerequisites.mdx"

React is a popular open-source JavaScript library developed by Meta for building user interfaces. Known for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering with a virtual DOM, React is widely used by companies of all sizes to create fast, scalable, and dynamic web applications.

This page explains how to use the @axiomhq/react library to send data from your client-side React apps to Axiom.

<Note>
    The @axiomhq/react library is part of the Axiom JavaScript SDK, an open-source project and welcomes your contributions. For more information, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-js).

    The @axiomhq/react library is currently in public preview. For more information, see [Feature states](/getting-started-guide/feature-states).

- A new or existing React app.

## Install @axiomhq/react library

1. In your terminal, go to the root folder of your React app and run the following command:

    ```sh
    npm install --save @axiomhq/logging @axiomhq/react
    ```

2. Create a `Logger` instance and export the utils. The example below uses the `useLogger` and `WebVitals` components.

    ```tsx [expandable]
    'use client';

    import { Logger, AxiomJSTransport } from '@axiomhq/logging';
    import { Axiom } from '@axiomhq/js';
    import { createUseLogger, createWebVitalsComponent } from '@axiomhq/react';

    const axiomClient = new Axiom({
      token: process.env.AXIOM_TOKEN!,
    });

    export const logger = new Logger({
      transports: [
        new AxiomJSTransport({
          client: axiomClient,
          dataset: process.env.AXIOM_DATASET!,
        }),
      ],
    });

    const useLogger = createUseLogger(logger);
    const WebVitals = createWebVitalsComponent(logger);

    export { useLogger, WebVitals };
    ```

## Send logs from components

To send logs from components, use the `useLogger` hook that returns your logger instance.

```tsx
import { useLogger } from "@/lib/axiom/client";

export default function ClientComponent() {
  const log = useLogger();
  log.debug("User logged in", { userId: 42 });
  const handleClick = () => log.info("User logged out");
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Logged in</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Log out</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Send Web Vitals

To send Web Vitals, mount the `WebVitals` component in the root of your React app.

```tsx
import { WebVitals } from "@/lib/axiom/client";

export default function App({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <main>
      <WebVitals />
      {children}
    </main>
  );
}
```
