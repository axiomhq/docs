#### Slash costs and reach answers faster

Amazon CloudWatch Logs is like a digital watchdog, stashing away log files from EC2 instances, CloudTrail, and other sources. Engineering teams using AWS often start with CloudWatch because it’s a breeze to set up and integrates well with the wider AWS ecosystem. But, as log volumes grow, CloudWatch can quickly drain your budget. Worse, the search and analytics experience is basic, especially when navigating logs from multiple AWS accounts or a variety of cloud platforms.

#### Why Amazon CloudWatch Logs falls short

**High and unpredictable costs:** The first reason for rethinking Amazon CloudWatch Logs is usually the cost. CloudWatch charges by GB ingested, stored, and analyzed. Logs in the Standard tier start at $0.50 per GB, not including storage and analysis costs. Comparing ingestion and storage alone for 5 TB of log data per day, CloudWatch is 3.5x more expensive ($79.5K/mo) than Axiom ($22.5K/mo).

**Log management price comparison USD for 5 TB of log data per day:**

|     | Axiom              |  AWS CloudWatch   |
| --- | ---                | --- |
|     | Ingest cost        | .15/GB * 5000 GB = $750 | .50/GB *5000 GB = $2,500 |
|     | Retention cost     | $0.00 | .03/GB *5000 GB = $150 |
|     | Standard retention | 95 days | 30 days |
|     | Total daily cost   | $750 | $2,650 |
|     | Total monthly cost | $22,500 | $79,500 |


Beyond ingest and storage, extra fees are applied for dashboards ($3.00 each), log metrics (starting at $0.30 per metric), and alarms (from $0.10 per alarm metric). With so many variables, estimating monthly charges gets tricky, and many CloudWatch users realize they could save big by switching to Axiom, getting more fidelity and analysis power for less cost.

**Clunky analytics workflows:** Once logs are stored in CloudWatch, teams have to sift through log groups and log streams to find insights. Log streams, sequences of log events from the same source, get split once they hit a volume threshold, which creates painfully slow and error-prone workflows.

## Axiom’s CloudWatch Forwarder

Axiom provides a unique way of ingesting CloudWatch logs into Axiom. The Axiom CloudWatch integration is subscribed to one or more of your CloudWatch Log Groups and runs as a Lambda function.

While there are other methods to ship logs from AWS Services, The [**CloudWatch Forwarder**](/send-data/cloudwatch) is the fastest way to get started with Axiom and AWS.

## Supported Amazon services

Checkout [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AWS-logs-and-resource-policy.html) of which services send logs to Cloudwatch and/or S3.
