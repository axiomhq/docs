For most AWS services, the fastest and easiest way to send logs to Axiom is the [Axiom CloudWatch Forwarder](/send-data/cloudwatch). Itâ€™s subscribed to one or more of your CloudWatch Log Groups and runs as a Lambda function. To determine which AWS service sends logs to Amazon Cloudwatch and/or Amazon S3, see the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AWS-logs-and-resource-policy.html).

## Choose the best method to send data

To choose the best method to send data from AWS services to Axiom, consider that Amazon CloudWatch Logs captures three main types of logs:
- **Service logs**: More than 30 AWS services, including Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, AWS CloudTrail, can send service logs to CloudWatch.
- **Vended logs**: Automatically published by certain AWS services like Amazon VPC and Amazon Route 53.
- **Custom logs**: Logs from your own applications, on-premise resources, and other clouds.

You can only send vended logs to Axiom through Amazon CloudWatch. Use the [Axiom CloudWatch Forwarder](/send-data/cloudwatch) to send vended logs from Amazon CloudWatch to Axiom for richer insights. After sending vended logs to Axiom, shorten the retention period for these logs in Amazon CloudWatch to cut costs even more.

For service logs and custom logs, you can skip Amazon CloudWatch altogether and send them to Axiom using open-source collectors like [Fluent Bit](/send-data/fluent-bit), [Fluentd](/send-data/fluentd) and [Vector](/send-data/vector). Completely bypassing Amazon CloudWatch results in significant cost savings.
