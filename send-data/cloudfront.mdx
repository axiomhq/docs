Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations.

Axiom built an easy way for you to send CloudFront logs to Axiom using AWS S3 bucket and Lambda. With this, you can observe your static and dynamic content and run deep queries on your CloudFront distribution logs efficiently and properly.

## Prerequisites

- Create an account on [AWS Cloud](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start/email)
- Sign up or log in to your [account on Axiom](https://app.axiom.co/login?return_to=%2F)
- In the Axiom UI, create a [dataset](/reference/datasets) and [API token](/reference/tokens) with ingest permissions for that dataset

## Installation

Axiom CloudFront integration is available open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-cloudfront-lambda). Select the stack you want to deploy and click launch stack.

There are two methods to send logs from CloudFront to Axiom using the launch stack:

- [If you created or have an S3 bucket for your CloudFront data](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/create/template?stackName=CloudFront-Axiom&templateURL=https://axiom-cloudformation-stacks.s3.amazonaws.com/axiom-cloudfront-lambda-base-cloudformation-stack.yaml): In this launch stack, you don’t need to create an S3 bucket. You just need to add your **Dataset Name** and **API Token**.

- [If you don’t have an S3 bucket created for your CloudFront data](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/create/template?stackName=CloudFront-Axiom&templateURL=https://axiom-cloudformation-stacks.s3.amazonaws.com/axiom-cloudfront-lambda-cloudformation-stack.yaml): This stack creates an S3 bucket for your CloudFront data, you also have to add your **Dataset Name** and **API Token**.
