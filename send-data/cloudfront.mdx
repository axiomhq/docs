Use the Axiom CloudFront Lambda to send CloudFront logs to Axiom using AWS S3 bucket and Lambda. After you set this up, you can observe your static and dynamic content and run deep queries on your CloudFront distribution logs efficiently and properly.

- [Create an account on AWS Cloud](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register).

## Setup

1. Select one of the following:
    - If you already have an S3 bucket for your CloudFront data, [launch the base stack on AWS](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/create/template?stackName=CloudFront-Axiom&templateURL=https://axiom-cloudformation-stacks.s3.amazonaws.com/axiom-cloudfront-lambda-base-cloudformation-stack.yaml).
    - If you donâ€™t have an S3 bucket for your CloudFront data, [launch the stack on AWS](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/create/template?stackName=CloudFront-Axiom&templateURL=https://axiom-cloudformation-stacks.s3.amazonaws.com/axiom-cloudfront-lambda-cloudformation-stack.yaml) that creates an S3 bucket for you.
1. Add the name of the Axiom dataset where you want to send data.
1. Enter the Axiom API token you have previously created.

## Configuration

To configure your CloudFront distribution:

1. In AWS, select your origin domain.
1. In **Origin access**, select **Legacy access identities**, and then select your origin access identity in the list.
1. In **Bucket policy**, select **Yes, update the bucket policy**.
1. In **Standard logging**, select **On**. This means that your data is delivered to your S3 bucket.
1. Click **Create Distribution**, and then click **Run your Distribution**.

Go back to Axiom to see the CloudFront distribution logs.
