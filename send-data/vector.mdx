Vector is a lightweight and ultra-fast tool for building observability pipelines. It has a built-in support for shipping logs to Axiom through the [`axiom` sink](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sinks/axiom/).

## Installation

Follow the [quickstart guide in the Vector documentation](https://vector.dev/docs/setup/quickstart/) to install Vector, and to configure sources and sinks.

## timestamp field

Before Vector version v0.42.0 the Axiom sink was based on an Elasticsearch endpoint, which constrained it to Elasticsearch wire
semantics. If you are using Vector version v0.41.1 or earlier, then the following semantics are applicable:

> Logs and metrics sent via Vector should use `@timestamp` as the timestamp field like: `{"@timestamp":"2022-04-14T21:30:30.658Z..."}`, not `_time`. Axiom accepts many date strings and timestamps without knowing the format in advance, including Unix Epoch, RFC3339, and ISO 8601.

As and from Vector version v0.42.0 the Vector Axiom sink is based integrated against the native Axiom ingest endpoint.

> This means the Vector Axiom sink is no longer constrained by Elasticsearch semantics, and the `_time` field can be used with its usual behaviour.

See below for migration example.

## Configuration

Send data to Axiom with Vector using the [`file` method](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sources/file/) and the [`axiom` sink](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sinks/axiom/).

The example below configures Vector to read and collect logs from files and send them to Axiom:

1. [Create a dataset in Axiom](/reference/settings#data).
2. [Generate an Axiom API token](/reference/settings#access-overview).
3. Create a vector configuration file `vector.toml` with the following content:

    ```toml
    [sources.VECTOR_SOURCE_ID]
    type = "file"
    include = ["PATH_TO_LOGS"]

    [sinks.SINK_ID]
    type = "axiom"
    inputs = ["VECTOR_SOURCE_ID"]
    token = "AXIOM_API_TOKEN"
    dataset = "AXIOM_DATASET"
    ```

4. In the code above, replace the following:
    - Replace `VECTOR_SOURCE_ID` with the Vector source ID.
    - Replace `PATH_TO_LOGS` with the path to the log files. For example, `/var/log/**/*.log`.
    - Replace `SINK_ID` with the sink ID.
    - Replace `AXIOM_API_TOKEN` with the Axiom API token you have generated.
    - Replace `AXIOM_DATASET` with the name of the Axiom dataset where you want to send data.

5. Run Vector to send logs to Axiom.

### Example with data transformation

The example below deletes a field before sending the data to Axiom:

```toml
[sources.VECTOR_SOURCE_ID]
type = "file"
include = ["PATH_TO_LOGS"]

[transforms.filter_json_fields]
type = "remap"
inputs = ["VECTOR_SOURCE_ID"]
source = '''
  . = del(.FIELD_TO_REMOVE)
'''

[sinks.SINK_ID]
type = "axiom"
inputs = ["filter_json_fields"]
token = "AXIOM_API_TOKEN"
dataset = "AXIOM_DATASET"
```

Replace `FIELD_TO_REMOVE` with the field you want to remove.

<Note>
Any changes to Vector’s `file` method can make the code example above outdated. If this happens, please refer to the [official Vector documentation on the `file` method](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sources/file/), and we kindly ask you to inform us of the issue using the feedback tool at the bottom of this page.

## Send Kubernetes logs to Axiom

Send Kubernetes logs to Axiom using the Kubernetes source.

```toml
[sources.my_source_id]
type = "kubernetes_logs"
auto_partial_merge = true
ignore_older_secs = 600
read_from = "beginning"
self_node_name = "${VECTOR_SELF_NODE_NAME}"
exclude_paths_glob_patterns = [ "**/exclude/**" ]
extra_field_selector = "metadata.name!=pod-name-to-exclude"
extra_label_selector = "my_custom_label!=my_value"
extra_namespace_label_selector = "my_custom_label!=my_value"
max_read_bytes = 2_048
max_line_bytes = 32_768
fingerprint_lines = 1
glob_minimum_cooldown_ms = 60_000
delay_deletion_ms = 60_000
data_dir = "/var/lib/vector"
timezone = "local"

[sinks.axiom]
type = "axiom"
inputs = ["my_source_id"]
token = "xaat-1234"
dataset = "vector-dev"
```

DATASET is the name of your dataset. When logs are sent from your vector, it’s stored in a dataset in Axiom.

[See creating a dataset for more](/reference/datasets)

TOKEN is used to ingest or query data to your dataset. API token can be generated from settings on Axiom dashboard.

## Send Docker logs to Axiom

To send Docker logs using the Axiom sink, you need to create a configuration file, for example, `vector.toml`, with the following content:

```toml
# Define the Docker logs source
[sources.docker_logs]
type = "docker_logs"
docker_host = "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"

# Define the Axiom sink
[sinks.axiom]
type = "axiom"
inputs = ["docker_logs"]
dataset = "your_dataset_name"  # replace with the name of your Axiom dataset
token = "your_api_token"  # replace with your Axiom API token
```

Replace `your_dataset_name` with the name of the [dataset](/reference/datasets) you want to send logs to in Axiom, and `your_api_token` with your [Axiom API token](/reference/tokens).

- Run Vector: Start Vector with the configuration file you just created:

```bash
vector --config /path/to/vector.toml
```

Vector collects logs from Docker and forward them to Axiom using the Axiom sink. You can view and analyze your logs in your dataset.

## Send AWS S3 logs to Axiom

To send AWS S3 logs using the Axiom sink, create a configuration file, for example, `vector.toml`, with the following content:

```toml
[sources.my_s3_source]
type = "aws_s3"
bucket = "my-bucket"  # replace with your bucket name
region = "us-west-2"  # replace with the AWS region of your bucket

[sinks.axiom]
type = "axiom"
inputs = ["my_s3_source"]
dataset = "your_dataset_name"  # replace with the name of your Axiom dataset
token = "your_api_token"  # replace with your Axiom API token
```

Finally, run Vector with the configuration file using `vector --config ./vector.toml`. This starts Vector and begins reading logs from the specified S3 bucket and sending them to the specified Axiom dataset.

## Send Kafka logs to Axiom

To send Kafka logs using the Axiom sink, you need to create a configuration file, for example, `vector.toml`, with the following code:

```toml
[sources.my_kafka_source]
type = "kafka" # must be: kafka
bootstrap_servers = "10.14.22.123:9092" # your Kafka bootstrap servers
group_id = "my_group_id" # your Kafka consumer group ID
topics = ["my_topic"] # the Kafka topics to consume from
auto_offset_reset = "earliest" # start reading from the beginning

[sinks.axiom]
type = "axiom"
inputs = ["my_kafka_source"]  # connect the Axiom sink to your Kafka source
dataset = "your_dataset_name"  # replace with the name of your Axiom dataset
token = "your_api_token"  # replace with your Axiom API token
```

Finally, you can start Vector with your configuration file: `vector --config /path/to/your/vector.toml`

## Send NGINX metrics to Axiom

To send NGINX metrics using Vector to the Axiom sink, first enable NGINX to emit metrics, then use Vector to capture and forward those metrics. Here is a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Enable NGINX Metrics

Configure NGINX to expose metrics. This typically involves enabling the `ngx_http_stub_status_module` module in your NGINX configuration.

1. Open your NGINX configuration file (often located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`) and in your `server` block, add:

```bash
location /metrics {
  stub_status;
  allow 127.0.0.1; # only allow requests from localhost
  deny all; # deny all other hosts
}
```

2. Restart or reload NGINX to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

This exposes basic NGINX metrics at the `/metrics` endpoint on your server.

### Step 2: Configure Vector

Configure Vector to scrape the NGINX metrics and send them to Axiom. Create a new configuration file (`vector.toml`), and add the following:

```toml
[sources.nginx_metrics]
type = "nginx_metrics" # must be: nginx_metrics
endpoints = ["http://localhost/metrics"] # the endpoint where NGINX metrics are exposed

[sinks.axiom]
type = "axiom" # must be: axiom
inputs = ["nginx_metrics"] # use the metrics from the NGINX source
dataset = "your_dataset_name"  # replace with the name of your Axiom dataset
token = "your_api_token"  # replace with your Axiom API token
```

Finally, you can start Vector with your configuration file: `vector --config /path/to/your/vector.toml`

## Send Syslog logs to Axiom

To send Syslog logs using the Axiom sink, you need to create a configuration file, for example, `vector.toml`, with the following code:

```toml
[sources.my_source_id]
type="syslog"
address="0.0.0.0:6514"
max_length=102_400
mode="tcp"

[sinks.axiom]
type="axiom"
inputs = [ "my_source_id" ] # required
dataset="your_dataset_name" # replace with the name of your Axiom dataset
token="your_api_token" # replace with your Axiom API token
```

## Send Prometheus metrics to Axiom

To send Prometheus scrape metrics using the Axiom sink, you need to create a configuration file, for example, `vector.toml`, with the following code:

```toml
# Define the Prometheus source that scrapes metrics
[sources.my_prometheus_source]
type = "prometheus_scrape"  # scrape metrics from a Prometheus endpoint
endpoints = ["http://localhost:9090/metrics"]  # replace with your Prometheus endpoint

# Define Axiom sink where logs will be sent
[sinks.axiom]
type = "axiom"  # Axiom type
inputs = ["my_prometheus_source"]  # connect the Axiom sink to your Prometheus source
dataset = "your_prometheus_dataset"  # replace with the name of your Axiom dataset
token = "your_api_token"  # replace with your Axiom API token
```

## Migrate from legacy ( v0.41.1 and earlier ) Vector to a more recent version

As timestamp field handling changed, it may be necessary
to change any references to remap logic to use the `_time` field instead, and remove the now redundant `timestamp` field:

```vrl
# file: example.vrl

# We set _time to an explicit, rather than allow axiom to default to `now`
. = set!(value: ., path: ["_time"],  data: .timestamp)

# We remove the original value, as it is effectively a duplicate
del(.timestamp)
```

And a sample vector configuration file:

```toml
# ... rest of your config file

[transforms.migrate]
type = "remap"
inputs = [ "k8s"]
file= 'example.vrl' # as above

[sinks.debug]
type = "axiom"
inputs = [ "migrate" ]
dataset = "my-axiom-dataset" # no change
token = "your-token" # no change

[sinks.debug.encoding]
codec = "json"
```

## Use `zstd` compression with Vector and Axiom

The changes to the Vector Axiom Sink enable the `zstd` compression
algorithm by default, however an explicit algorithm can be set if
appropriate for your use case:

```toml
# ... rest of your config file

[transforms.migrate]
type = "remap"
inputs = [ "k8s"]
file= 'example.vrl' # as above

[sinks.debug]
type = "axiom"
compression = "gzip" # Typically does not compress as well as zstd!
inputs = [ "migrate" ]
dataset = "my-axiom-dataset" # no change
token = "your-token" # no change

[sinks.debug.encoding]
codec = "json"
```
