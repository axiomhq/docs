The Secure Syslog endpoint allows you to send syslog data to Axiom over a secure connection. With the Secure Syslog endpoint, the logs you send to Axiom are encrypted using SSL/TLS.

## Syslog limitations and recommended alternatives

Syslog is an outdated protocol. Some of the limitations are the following:

- Lack of error reporting and feedback mechanisms when issues occur.
- Inability to gracefully end the connection. This can result in missing data.

<Note>
For a more reliable and modern logging experience, consider using tools like [Vector](https://vector.dev/) to receive syslog messages and [forward them to Axiom](/send-data/vector). This approach bypasses many of syslog’s limitations.

## Configure syslog client

1. Ensure the syslog client meets the following requirements:
    - **Message size limit:** Axiom currently enforces a 64KB per-message size limit. This is in line with RFC5425 guidelines. Any message exceeding the limit causes the connection to close because Axiom doesn’t support ingesting truncated messages.
    - **TLS requirement:** Axiom only supports syslog over TLS, specifically following RFC5425. Ensure you have certificate authority certificates installed in your environment to validate Axiom’s SSL certificate. For example, on Ubuntu/Debian systems, install the `ca-certificates` package. For more information, see the [RFC Series documentation](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5425).
    - **Port requirements:** TCP log messages are sent on TCP port `6514`.
1. Configure your syslog client to connect to Axiom. Use the target URL for the endpoint you have generated in Axiom by following the procedure above. For example, `https://opbizplsf8klnw.ingress.axiom.co`. Consider this URL as secret information because syslog doesn’t support additional authentication such as API tokens.

## Troubleshooting

Ensure your messages conform to the size limit and TLS requirements. If the connection is frequently re-established and messages are rejected, the issue can be the size of the messages or other formatting issues.
