## Setup

1. In Axiom, determine the ID of the dataset youâ€™ve created.
1. In AWS Firehose, create an HTTP endpoint destination. For more information, see the [AWS Firehose documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/create-destination.html#create-destination-http).
1. Set the URL of the HTTP endpoint destination to `https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/DATASET_NAME/ingest/firehose`. Replace `DATASET_NAME` with the name of the Axiom dataset.
1. Set the Axiom API token as the access key.

You have configured AWS Firehose to send data to Axiom. Go to the Axiom UI and ensure your dataset receives events properly.
