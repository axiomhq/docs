This page explains how to auto-instrument and monitor applications running on AWS Lambda using the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT). ADOT is an OpenTelemetry collector layer managed by and optimized for AWS.

Alternatively, you can use the Axiom Lambda Extension to send Lambda function logs and platform events to Axiom. For more information, see [AWS Lambda](/send-data/aws-lambda).

Axiom detects the extension and provides you with quick filters and a dashboard. For more information on how this enriches your Axiom organization, see [AWS Lambda app](/apps/lambda).

## ADOT Lambda collector layer

[AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Lambda](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda) provides a plug-and-play user experience by automatically instrumenting a Lambda function. It packages OpenTelemetry together with an out-of-the-box configuration for AWS Lambda and OTLP in an easy-to-setup layer. You can turn on and off OpenTelemetry for your Lambda function without changing your code.

With the ADOT collector layer, you can send telemetry data to Axiom with a simple configuration.

## Set up ADOT Lambda layer

This example creates a new Lambda function and applies the ADOT Lambda layer to it with the proper configuration.

You can deploy your Lambda function with the choice of your runtime. This example uses the Python3.10 runtime.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a new Lambda function">

Create a new Lambda function with the following content. For more information on creating Lambda functions, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html).

```python
import json

print('Loading function')


def lambda_handler(event, context):
    #print("Received event: " + json.dumps(event, indent=2))
    print("value1 = " + event['key1'])
    print("value2 = " + event['key2'])
    print("value3 = " + event['key3'])
    return event['key1']  # Echo back the first key value
    #raise Exception('Something went wrong')
```
</Step>
<Step title="Add the ADOT Lambda layer">

Add a new ADOT Lambda layer to your function with the following ARN (Amazon Resource Name). For more information on adding layers to your function, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/adding-layers.html).

```bash
arn:aws:lambda:AWS_REGION:901920570463:layer:aws-otel-python-ARCH-VERSION
```

- Replace `AWS_REGION` with the AWS Region to send the request to. For example, `us-west-1`.
- Replace `ARCH` with the system architecture type. For example, `arm64`.
- Replace `VERSION` with the latest version number specified in the [AWS documentation](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda/lambda-python). For example, `ver-1-25-0:1`.

</Step>
<Step title="Create the collector configuration file">

The configuration file is a YAML file that contains the configuration for the OpenTelemetry collector. Create the configuration file `/var/task/collector.yaml` with the following content. This tells the collector to receive telemetry data from the OTLP receiver and export it to Axiom.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

exporters:
  otlphttp:
    compression: gzip
    endpoint: https://AXIOM_DOMAIN
    headers:
      authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN
      x-axiom-dataset: DATASET_NAME

service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
```

</Step>
<Step title="Set environment variables">

Set the following environment variables. For more information on setting environment variables, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html).

```bash
AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER: /opt/otel-instrument
OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_CONFIG_FILE: /var/task/collector.yaml
```

- `AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER` wraps the function handler with the OpenTelemetry Lambda wrapper. This layer enables the auto-instrumentation for your Lambda function by initializing the OpenTelemetry agent and handling the lifecycle of spans.
- `OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_CONFIG_FILE` specified the location of the collector configuration file.

</Step>
<Step title="Run your function and observe telemetry data in Axiom">

As the app runs, it sends traces to Axiom. To view the traces:

1. In Axiom, click the **Stream** tab.
1. Click your dataset.
