Render is a unified cloud to build and run all your apps and websites with free TLS certificates, a global CDN, DDoS protection, private networks, and auto deploys from Git.

Axiom provides complete visibility into your Render projects, allowing you to monitor the behavior of your websites and apps. Axiom’s Syslog Endpoint integration uses Render’s log stream to capture data about the status and performance of your websites and apps.

## Prerequisites

- Create and sign in to your account on [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/)
- Sign up or log in to your account on [Axiom](https://app.axiom.co/)
- In Axiom, create a [dataset](/reference/datasets) and an [API token](/reference/tokens) with ingest permissions.

## Installation

- In Axiom, select **Endpoints** and create a new **Endpoint** with the **Secure Syslog** Service on the dataset you created.

- When you create your Endpoint service, the endpoint is in the following format `tcp+tls://pokloi5io9y4b.syslog.axiom.co:6514`

## Configuration

- Create and connect to your app on Render. Your app can be a static site, web service, Redis, or background worker.

- Next, select Log Streams in your account settings on Render and add the log endpoint created during [installation](/send-data/render#installation).

- Back in your dataset, you see your logs coming in from Render in your dataset so you can get insights into your website requests and identify potential bottlenecks in any app hosted on Render.
