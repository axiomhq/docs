Serverless is an open-source web framework for building apps on AWS Lambda. Sending event data from your Serverless apps to Axiom allows you to gain deep insights into your appsâ€™ performance and behavior without complex setup or configuration.

To send data from Serverless to Axiom:

1. [Create an Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/register).
2. [Create a dataset in Axiom](/reference/datasets) where you send your data.
3. [Create an API token in Axiom](/reference/tokens) with permissions to update the dataset you have created.
4. [Create a Serverless account](https://app.serverless.com/).
5. Set up your app with Serverless using the [Serverless documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started).
6. Configure Axiom in your Serverless Framework Service using the [Serverless documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/observability/axiom). During this process, you need the following:
    - The name of the Axiom dataset where you want to send data.
    - The Axiom API token you have generated.
