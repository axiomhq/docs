Serverless is an open-source web framework for building apps on AWS Lambda. Sending event data from your Serverless apps to Axiom allows you to gain deep insights into your appsâ€™ performance and behavior without complex setup or configuration.

To send data from Serverless to Axiom:

1. [Create an Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/register).
2. [Create an API token in Axiom](/reference/tokens) with **Ingest**, **Query**, **Datasets**, **Dashboards**, and **Monitors** permissions.
3. [Create a Serverless account](https://app.serverless.com/).
4. Set up your app with Serverless using the [Serverless documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started).
5. Configure Axiom in your Serverless Framework Service using the [Serverless documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/observability/axiom).
