Log Drains make it easy to collect logs from your deployments and forward them to archival, search, and alerting services by sending them via HTTPS, HTTP, TLS, and TCP.

## Heroku Log Drains

With Heroku log drains you can forward logs from your apps, and deployments to Axiom by sending them via HTTPS.

## Prerequisites

[Create and sign in to your Axiom Account.](https://app.axiom.co/login?return_to=%2F)

## Installation

Sign up and login to your account on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), and download the Heroku [CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)

## Configuration

Heroku log drains configuration consists of three main components

```bash
heroku drains:add https://:<$API_TOKEN>@api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/<$DATASET_NAME>/ingest -a <$HEROKU_APPLICATION_NAME>
```

Where:

- API_TOKEN: is used to send data to your dataset. API token can be generated from settings on Axiom dashboard.

[See creating an API token for more](/reference/tokens)

- DATASET_NAME: name of your dataset. When logs are sent from your Heroku app itâ€™s stored in a dataset on Axiom.

Dataset can be created from the settings page on Axiom.

[See creating a dataset for more](/reference/datasets)

- HEROKU_APPLICATION_NAME: is the name of your app created on the Heroku dashboard or on the Heroku CLI.
