Log drains make it easy to collect logs from your deployments and forward them to archival, search, and alerting services by sending them through HTTPS, HTTP, TLS, and TCP.

## Heroku Log Drains

With Heroku log drains, you can forward logs from your apps and deployments to Axiom using HTTPS.

## Prerequisites

[Create and sign in to your Axiom account.](https://app.axiom.co/login?return_to=%2F)

## Installation

Sign up and sign in to your account on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), and download the Heroku [CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install).

## Configuration

The Heroku log drains configuration consists of three main components:

```bash
heroku drains:add https://:<$API_TOKEN>@api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/<$DATASET_NAME>/ingest -a <$HEROKU_APPLICATION_NAME>
```

Where:

- API_TOKEN: Used to send data to your dataset. You can generate an API token from the Settings page on the Axiom dashboard.

[See creating an API token for more](/reference/tokens)

- DATASET_NAME: The name of your dataset. When logs are sent from your Heroku app, they're stored in a dataset on Axiom.

You can create a dataset from the Settings page on Axiom.

[See creating a dataset for more](/reference/datasets)

- HEROKU_APPLICATION_NAME: The name of your app created on the Heroku dashboard or through the Heroku CLI.

[See creating a Heroku app for more](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/creating-apps)

Back in your dataset, you can see your Heroku logs.
