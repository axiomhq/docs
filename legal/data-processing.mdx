This Data Processing Addendum (“**DPA**”) is incorporated into and forms part of the Axiom Terms of Service [https://axiom.co/docs/legal/terms-of-service](/legal/terms-of-service) or other applicable agreement governing the use of the Services (the “**Agreement**”).

**By accessing or using the Services, or otherwise indicating your acceptance of the Agreement, Customer hereby agrees to the terms of this DPA on behalf of itself and any affiliated entities it represent.**

This DPA applies to Axiom Inc.’s (“**Axiom**” or “**Company**”) Processing of Personal Data in connection with the Services and is effective as of the date Customer first access or use of the Services after the date of publication of this DPA (the “**Effective Date**”).  This DPA does not require a signature to be valid or enforceable and is deemed to be mutually agreed upon and entered into by Customer and Axiom through Customer’s acceptance of the Agreement.  This DPA applies only if and to the extent Applicable Data Protection Laws govern Axiom’s Processing of Customer Personal Data in performance of the Services as a ‘processor’, ‘service provider’ or similar role defined under Data Protection Laws. Accordingly, this DPA does not apply to Axiom’s Processing of any Personal Data for its own business or customer relationship, administration purposes, its own marketing or service analytics, its own information and systems security purposes supporting the operation of the Services, nor its own legal, regulatory or compliance purposes.

**5. Security and Personal Data Breaches**

5.1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, Company will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk, including the measures listed in Annex II.

**Annex II**

**TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY MEASURES**

**DPA - Technical and Organizational Security Measures Annex**

The Company will implement the following specific security measures, as applicable:

|   |   |
|---|---|
| **Security Management** | Axiom maintains a comprehensive written information security program (ISP) that is aligned with leading security frameworks, including ISO 27001 and SOC 2. This program includes policies, processes, and controls governing the processing of Personal Data, designed to: (a) Secure Personal Data against accidental or unlawful loss, access, or disclosure; (b) Identify and manage reasonably foreseeable risks to the security of the Axiom Production Environment; and (c) Minimize security risks through continuous risk assessment and regular testing. For the purpose of this Schedule, the “Axiom Production Environment" means Axiom's cloud infrastructure, servers, networking services, assets, and hosting software and systems managed by Axiom within its cloud service providers (including Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cloudflare) used to process or store Personal Data. |
| **Maintaining of an Information Security Policy** | Axiom's ISP is established and maintained in accordance with its **SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certifications**. The policies are regularly reviewed, updated, and communicated to all relevant personnel. Security policies and procedures clearly define information security responsibilities for all aspects of our service, including: Maintaining and reviewing security policies and procedures. Secure software development (SDLC), operation, and maintenance. Security incident response and escalation procedures. User access administration based on the Principle of Least Privilege. Monitoring and control of all systems within the Axiom Production Environment. |
| **Secure Networks and Systems** | To protect Personal Data, Axiom utilizes a multi-layered security approach, leveraging cloud-native technologies such as **Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), security groups, network access control lists (NACLs), and web application firewalls (WAFs)**. These controls are configured to deny all traffic by default and only permit traffic required for the provision of the service, effectively isolating the Axiom Production Environment from untrusted networks. All network security configurations are documented, subject to change control, and reviewed regularly. |
| **Personal Data Protection Measures (including storage limitation, data minimization and retention and encryption)**  | **Encryption:** All Personal Data is encrypted both **at rest** using strong encryption standards (e.g., AES-256) and **in transit** across public networks using industry-standard cryptographic protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher). We have documented procedures to protect cryptographic keys against misuse. **Data Minimization & Retention:** In line with our compliance obligations, including **HIPAA**, Axiom limits Personal Data storage to the minimum necessary for the provision of our services and enforces defined data retention and disposal policies. |
| **Vulnerability Management Efforts** | Axiom protects its systems against malicious software using advanced **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** solutions and automated malware scanning. We maintain secure systems and applications by: Establishing processes to continuously identify and remediate security vulnerabilities. Implementing strict change management procedures, including the separation of development, testing, and production environments. Personal Data is not used in non-production environments. Following a secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) that incorporates security reviews, code analysis, and testing throughout the development process. |
| **Access Control Measures**  | Access to Personal Data is strictly restricted on a **need-to-know basis** (Principle of Least Privilege) and limited to authorized personnel for legitimate business purposes. This is achieved by: Utilizing a centralized **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** system with a default "deny-all" setting. Assigning individually unique IDs to all users and requiring **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for access to the Axiom Production Environment. Enforcing strong password complexity rules and implementing processes for timely provisioning, modification, and de-provisioning of user access. Automatically locking user accounts after repeated failed login attempts and terminating idle sessions. |
| **Restriction of Physical Access to Personal Data Processing Systems** | As a cloud-native company, Axiom does not own or operate physical data centers. We leverage premier cloud service providers (**AWS and Cloudflare**), which are responsible for the physical security of the data centers housing the Axiom Production Environment. These providers are leading global companies that maintain robust physical security programs with controls such as: 24/7/365 on-site security personnel. Biometric and electronic access control. Perimeter security, including fencing and video surveillance. Regular audits and certifications (e.g., **SOC 2, ISO 27001**). Axiom ensures that backups are encrypted, logically secured, and stored in geo-redundant locations. Media containing Personal Data is disposed of using secure data destruction techniques. |
| **Regular Monitoring and Testing of Networks** | Access to Recipient Network and Personal Data is monitored using mechanisms that allow tracking, alerting, and analysis on a regular basis as well as upon need.  All systems that process Personal Data are provided with correct and consistent time and audit trails. Audit trails for critical systems are kept for, at least, one year.  The security of our systems is regularly tested as part of our **ISO 27001 and SOC 2** compliance programs, including: **Quarterly** internal and external network vulnerability scans. **Annual** internal and external penetration tests conducted by a qualified third party. Test findings are tracked and remediated in a timely manner according to their severity. |
| **Incident Response Plan**  | Axiom maintains a formal Incident Response Plan to ensure a timely and effective response to any security breach. The plan is tested regularly and includes procedures for identification, containment, eradication, and recovery, as well as breach notification procedures. Axiom also maintains a **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR)** plan, which includes data backup and recovery procedures that are tested regularly to ensure service availability. |
| **Third Party Risk Management Program** | Axiom maintains a formal **Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)** program. Before engaging any new vendor or service provider that will access Personal Data or the Axiom Production Environment, we conduct a thorough due diligence process to assess their security and compliance posture. |
