c. When any new Subprocessor is engaged, Axiom will notify Customer of the engagement, which notice may be given by updating the Subprocessor Page and/or via a message through email or the Service. Axiom will give such notice at least ten (10) calendar days before the new Subprocessor Processes any Customer Data, except that if Axiom reasonably believes engaging a new Subprocessor on an expedited basis is necessary to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the Customer Data or avoid material disruption to the Services, Axiom will give such notice as soon as reasonably practicable. If, within five (5) calendar days after such notice, Customer notifies Axiom in writing that Customer objects to Axiom’s appointment of a new Subprocessor based on reasonable data protection concerns, the parties will discuss such concerns in good faith and whether they can be resolved. If the parties are not able to mutually agree to a resolution of such concerns, Customer, as its sole and exclusive remedy, may terminate the Agreement for convenience with no refunds and Customer will remain liable to pay any committed fees in an order form, order, statement of work or other similar ordering document.

7\. Security 

a. Security Measures. Axiom will implement and maintain technical and organizational security measures designed to protect Customer Data from Security Incidents and to preserve the security and confidentiality of the Customer Data, in accordance with Axiom’s security standards referenced in the Agreement (“**Security Measures**”).

b. Customer Responsibility.

(i) Customer is responsible for reviewing the information made available by Axiom relating to data security and making an independent determination as to whether the Services meet Customer’s requirements and legal obligations under Applicable Data Protection Laws. Customer acknowledges that the Security Measures may be updated from time to time upon reasonable notice to Customer to reflect process improvements or changing practices (but the modifications will not materially decrease Axiom’s obligations as compared to those reflected in such terms as of the Effective Date).

(ii) Customer agrees that, without limitation of Axiom’s obligations under this Section 7, Customer is solely responsible for its use of the Services, including (a) making appropriate use of the Services to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk in respect of the Customer Data; (b) securing the account authentication credentials, systems and devices Customer uses to access the Services; (c) securing Customer’s systems and devices that it uses with the Services; and (d) maintaining its own backups of Customer Data.

c. Security Incident. Upon becoming aware of a confirmed Security Incident, Axiom will notify Customer without undue delay unless prohibited by applicable law. A delay in giving such notice requested by law enforcement and/or in light of Axiom’s legitimate needs to investigate or remediate the matter before providing notice will not constitute an undue delay. Such notices will describe, to the extent possible, details of the Security Incident, including steps taken to mitigate the 

potential risks and steps Axiom recommends Customer take to address the Security Incident. Without prejudice to Axiom’s obligations under this Section 7.c., Customer is solely responsible for complying with Security Incident notification laws applicable to Customer and fulfilling any third-party notification obligations related to any Security Incidents. Axiom’s notification of or response to a Security Incident under this Section 7.c. will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Axiom of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident.

8\. Audits and Reviews of Compliance. The parties acknowledge that Customer must be able to assess Axiom’s compliance with its obligations under Applicable Data Protection Law and this Addendum, insofar as Axiom is acting as a processor on behalf of Customer.

a. Axiom’s Audit Program. Axiom uses external auditors to verify the adequacy of its security measures with respect to its processing of Customer Data and is seeking SOC2 Type 2 compliance. Such audits are performed at least once annually at Axiom’s expense by independent third-party security professionals at Axiom’s selection and result in the generation of a confidential audit report (“**Audit Report**”).

b. Customer Audit. Upon Customer’s written request at reasonable intervals, and subject to reasonable confidentiality controls, Axiom will make available to Customer a copy of Axiom’s most recent Audit Report. Customer agrees that any audit rights granted by Applicable Data Protection Laws will be satisfied by these Audit Reports. To the extent that Axiom’s provision of an Audit Report does not provide sufficient information for Customer to verify Axiom’s compliance with this Addendum or Customer is required to respond to a regulatory authority audit, Customer agrees to a mutually agreed-upon audit plan with Axiom that: (a) ensures the use of an independent third party; (b) provides notice to Axiom in a timely fashion; (c) requests access only during business hours; (d) accepts billing to Customer at Axiom’s then-current rates; (e) occurs no more than once annually; (f) restricts findings to only Customer Data relevant to Customer; and (g) obligates Customer, to the extent permitted by law or regulation, to keep confidential any information gathered that, by its nature, should be confidential.

9\. Impact Assessments and Consultations. Axiom will provide reasonable cooperation to Customer in connection with any data protection impact assessment (at Customer’s expense only if such reasonable cooperation will require Axiom to assign significant resources to that effort) or consultations with regulatory authorities that may be required in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Laws.

10\. Data Subject Requests. Axiom will upon Customer’s request (and at Customer’s expense) provide Customer with such assistance as it may reasonably require to comply with its obligations under Applicable Data Protection Laws to respond to requests from individuals to exercise their rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of data access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability and objection) in cases where Customer cannot reasonably fulfill such requests independently by using the self-service functionality of the Services. If Axiom receives a request from a Data Subject in relation to their Customer Data, Axiom will advise the Data Subject to submit their request to Customer, and Customer will be responsible for responding to any such request.

11\. Return or Deletion of Customer Data 

a. Axiom will, within sixty (60) days after request by Customer following the termination or expiration of the Agreement, delete all Customer Data from Axiom’s systems.

b. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer understands that Axiom may retain Customer Data if required by law, and such data will remain subject to the requirements of this Addendum.

12\. International Provisions

**SCHEDULE 2** 

**TECHNICAL & ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY MEASURES** 

Where applicable, this Schedule 2 will serve as Annex II to the Standard Contractual Clauses. The following provides more information regarding Axiom’s technical and organizational security measures set forth below.

Technical and Organizational Security Measures: 

1\. Measures of pseudonymization and encryption of personal data.

Axiom maintains Customer Data in an encrypted format at rest using Advanced Encryption Standard and in transit using TLS.

2\. Measures for ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, and availability and resilience of processing systems and services.

Axiom's customer agreements contain strict confidentiality obligations. Additionally, Axiom requires every downstream Subprocessor to sign confidentiality provisions that are substantially similar to those contained in Axiom's customer agreements. The infrastructure for the Axiom Services spans multiple fault-independent AWS availability zones in geographic regions physically separated from one another, supported by various tools and processes to maintain high availability of services.

3\. Measures for ensuring the ability to restore availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.

Axiom performs regular backups of Customer Data, which is hosted in AWS data centers. Backups are retained redundantly across multiple availability zones and encrypted in-transit and at-rest using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256).

4\. Processes for regular testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures in order to ensure the security of processing.

Axiom maintains a risk-based assessment security program. The framework for Axiom’s security program includes administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards reasonably designed to protect the Services and confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Customer Data. Axiom’s security program is intended to be appropriate to the nature of the Services and the size and complexity of Axiom’s business operations. Axiom has a separate and dedicated security team that manages Axiom’s security program. This team facilitates and supports independent audits and assessments performed by third-parties to provide independent feedback on the operating effectiveness of the information security program.

5\. Measures for user identification and authorization.

Axiom personnel are required to use unique user access credentials and passwords for authorization. Axiom follows the principles of least privilege through role-based and time-based access models when provisioning system access. Axiom personnel are authorized to access Customer Data based on their job function, role and responsibilities, and such access requires approval prior to access provisioning. Access is promptly removed upon role change or termination.

6\. Measures for the protection of data during transmission.

Customer Data is encrypted when in-transit between Customer and Axiom Service using TLS.

7\. Measures for the protection of data during storage.

Customer Data is stored encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard.

8\. Measures for ensuring physical security of locations at which personal data are processed.

Axiom headquarters and office spaces have a physical security program that manages visitors, building entrances, CCTVs (closed circuit televisions), and overall office security. All employees,  
contractors, and visitors are required to identify themselves and have unique access tokens. Physical security controls are inherited from our co-working office provider.

The Services operate on Amazon Web Services (“**AWS**”) and are protected by the security and environmental controls of Amazon and Google, respectively.

Detailed information about AWS security is available at: 

\- https://aws.amazon.com/security/ and 

\- http://aws.amazon.com/security/sharing-the-security-responsibility/.

For AWS SOC Reports, please see: 

\- https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/soc-faqs/ 

9\. Measures for ensuring events logging.

Axiom monitors access to applications, tools, and resources that process or store Customer Data, including cloud services. Monitoring of security logs is centralized by the security team. Log activities are investigated when necessary and escalated appropriately.

10\. Measures for ensuring systems configuration, including default configuration.

Axiom applies Secure Software Development Lifecycle (Secure SDLC) standards to perform numerous security-related activities for the Services across different phases of the product creation lifecycle from requirements gathering and product design all the way through product deployment. These activities include, but are not limited to, the performance of (a) internal security reviews before new Services are deployed; (b) bi-annual penetration testing by independent third parties; and (c) threat models for new Services to detect any potential security threats and vulnerabilities.

Axiom adheres to a change management process to administer changes to the production environment for the Services, including changes to its underlying software, applications, and systems. Monitors are in place to notify the security team of changes made to critical infrastructure and services that do not adhere to the change management processes.

11\. Measures for internal IT and IT security governance and management.

Axiom maintains a risk-based assessment security program. The framework for Axiom’s security program includes administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards reasonably designed to protect the Services and confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Customer Data. Axiom’s security program is intended to be appropriate to the nature of the Services and the size and complexity of Axiom’s business operations. Axiom has a separate and dedicated Information Security team that manages Axiom’s security program. This team facilitates and supports independent audits and assessments performed by third parties. Axiom’s security framework is based on the ISO 27001 Information Security Management System and includes programs covering: Policies and Procedures, Asset Management, Access Management, Cryptography, Physical Security, Operations Security, Communications Security, Business Continuity Security, People Security, Product Security, Cloud and Network Infrastructure Security, Security Compliance, Third-Party Security, Vulnerability Management, and Security Monitoring and Incident Response. Security is managed at the highest  
levels of the company, with security and technology leadership meeting with executive management regularly to discuss issues and coordinate company-wide security initiatives. Information security policies and standards are reviewed and approved by management at least annually and are made available to all Axiom employees for their reference.

12\. Measures for certifications/assurance of processes and products.

Axiom conducts various third-party audits to attest to various frameworks including ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type 2, and bi-annual application penetration testing.

13\. Measures for ensuring data minimization.

Axiom Customers unilaterally determine what Customer Data they route through the Axiom Services and how the Services are configured. As such, Axiom operates on a shared responsibility model. Axiom provides tools within the Services that gives Customers control over exactly what data enters the platform and enables Customers with the ability to block data at the Source level. Additionally, Axiom allows Customers to delete and suppress Customer Data on demand.

14\. Measures for ensuring data quality.

Axiom has a three-fold approach for ensuring data quality. These measures include: (i) unit testing to ensure the quality of logic used to make API calls, (ii) volume testing to ensure the code is able to scale, and (iii) daily end-to-end testing to ensure that the input values match expected values. Axiom applies these measures across the board, both to ensure the quality of any Usage Data that Axiom collects and to ensure that the Axiom Platform is operating in accordance with the documentation.

Each Axiom Customer chooses what Customer Data they route through the Axiom Services and how the Services are configured. As such, Axiom operates on a shared responsibility model. Axiom ensures that data quality is maintained from the time a Customer sends Customer Data into the Services and until that Customer Data leaves Axiom to flow to a downstream destination.

15\. Measures for ensuring limited data retention.

Axiom Customers unilaterally determine what Customer Data they route through the Axiom Services and how the Services are configured. As such, Axiom operates on a shared responsibility model. If a Customer is unable to delete Customer Data via the self-services functionality of the Services, then Axiom deletes Customer Data upon the Customer's written request, within the timeframe specified in the Data Protection Addendum and in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Law.

16\. Measures for ensuring accountability.

Axiom has adopted measures for ensuring accountability, such as implementing data protection policies across the business, publishing Axiom's Information Security Policy (available at https://axiom.co/security), maintaining documentation of processing activities, and recording and reporting Security Incidents involving Personal Data. Axiom conducts regular third-party audits to ensure compliance with our privacy and security standards.

17\. Measures for allowing data portability and ensuring erasure.

Axiom's Customers have direct relationships with their end users and are responsible for responding to requests from their end users who wish to exercise their rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws. Axiom has functionality that allows Customers to delete and suppress Customer Data. Axiom specifies in the Data Protection Addendum that it will provide assistance to such Customer as may reasonably be require to comply with Customer's obligations under Applicable Data Protection Laws to respond to requests from individuals to exercise their rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of data access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability and objection). If Axiom receives a request from a Data Subject in relation to their Customer Data, Axiom will advise the Data Subject to submit their request to Customer, and Customer will be responsible for responding to any such request.

18\. For transfers to \[sub\]-processors, also describe the specific technical and organizational measures to be taken by the \[sub\]-processor to be able to provide assistance to the controller and, for transfers from a processor to a \[sub\]-processor, to the data exporter.

When Axiom engages a sub-processor under this Addendum, Axiom and the sub-processor enter into an agreement with data protection terms substantially similar to those contained herein. Each sub-processor agreement must ensure that Axiom is able to meet its obligations to Customer. In addition to implementing technical and organizational measures to protect personal data, sub-processors must a) notify Axiom in the event of a Security Incident so Axiom may notify Customer; b) delete data when instructed by Axiom in accordance with Customer’s instructions to Axiom; c) not engage additional sub-processors without authorization; d) not change the location where data is processed; or e) process data in a manner which conflicts with Customer’s instructions to Axiom.
