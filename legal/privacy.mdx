Axiom, Inc. complies with the EU–US Data Privacy Framework (EU–US DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States.  Axiom has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU–US DPF Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU–US DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the EU–US DPF and to view our certification, please visit:  
[https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).  We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

We may share your personal information with third-party companies and individuals that perform services on our behalf, such as hosting, analytics, email delivery, or customer support. We require these agents to process personal information only for limited and specified purposes consistent with the EU–US DPF Principles, and to provide the same level of protection for the personal information as required under the DPF. We remain responsible and liable under the DPF if a third-party agent processes personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we can prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

We will not collect or process “sensitive” personal information (as defined by the DPF) — including information about health, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, or sexual orientation — without first obtaining your explicit opt-in consent.

In compliance with the EU–US Data Privacy Framework Principles, Axiom commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our EU–US DPF policy should first contact us at:

**privacy@axiom.co**  
Axiom, Inc., 1390 Market Street, Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94102

We have further committed to refer unresolved DPF complaints to JAMS, a U.S.-based independent dispute resolution provider. This service is provided free of charge to you. You can find more information and file a complaint with our dispute resolution provider here: [https://www.jamsadr.com/submit/](https://www.jamsadr.com/submit/).  If your DPF complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke **binding arbitration** for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See the EU–US DPF website for more information.

We will conduct periodic self-assessments of our privacy practices to verify that the statements we make in this Privacy Policy are accurate and that our privacy practices have been implemented as described.
