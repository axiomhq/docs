## What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer when you visit a site. Cookies serve different purposes, like helping us understand how our site is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your browsing experience. Cookies can also help ensure advertising you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.

## Who places cookies on my device?

Cookies set by the site you visit are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than us are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality within the site, such as site analytics, advertising and social media features. The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer or device both when it visits the site in question and also when it visits certain other sites and/or mobile apps. We do not control how these third parties' use your information, which is subject to their own privacy policies. See below for details on use of third party cookies and similar technologies with our sites and app.

## How long will cookies stay on my device?

The length of time a cookie will stay on your device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device after you have finished browsing until they expire or are deleted.

## What other tracking technologies should I know about?

Cookies are not the only way to track visitors to a site or app. Companies use tiny graphics files with unique identifiers called beacons (and also "pixels" or "clear gifs") to recognize when someone visits its sites. These technologies often depend on cookies to function properly, and so disabling cookies may impair their functioning.
