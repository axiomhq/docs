Axiom is committed to delivering a reliable, performant, and secure data platform. We want our customers to have full confidence in the Axiom Service, backed by transparent commitments. This Service Quality document covers:

1. **Service availability** and corresponding SLAs  
2. **Priorities, support response times, and escalation**  
3. **Incident management and communications**

Please note this Axiom Service Quality document is subject to the agreement between Customer and Axiom with respect to the Axiom Service (the “Agreement”).  All terms not otherwise defined herein are defined as set forth in the Agreement.

## Service availability

### Scope

This Axiom Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) describes the service availability regarding the Axiom Service specified in the applicable Service Description or otherwise ordered by Customer.  This SLA   applies to the core functionality of the applicable Axiom Service: components such as data ingestion, query execution, alerting, and access to the Axiom Console and API;  it does not apply to preview features unless otherwise noted herein.  

### Availability commitments

Axiom provides the following target uptime (the “Monthly Uptime Percentage” or “MUP”) with respect to Axiom Cloud:

| Axiom Service | Monthly Uptime Percentage |
| :---- | :---- |
| Axiom Cloud | At least 99.9% (“three nines”) |

Axiom measures MUP on a calendar-month basis by taking the total minutes in a calendar month, subtracting any Scheduled Downtime and Exclusions, and then calculating how many of the remaining minutes the Axiom service was available.

### Scheduled and unscheduled downtime

* **Scheduled Downtime:** means the maintenance windows that Axiom communicates to Customer at least seven (7) days in advance. Axiom strives to limit Scheduled Downtime to three (3) hours per month.  
    
* **Unscheduled Downtime**: means any period of time the Axiom Service is unavailable, other than Scheduled Downtime or Exclusions. For example, system failures, unplanned service degradations, or regional outages.  
    
* **Exclusions:**  means any of the following:   
  * emergency maintenance;   
  * circumstances or events beyond the reasonable control of Axiom, including without limitation, any Force Majeure events;   
  * the performance or availability of local internet-service-providers engaged by Customer, and outages directly traceable to external providers (e.g., cloud platforms, DNS);  
  * issues resulting from Customer’s use of third-party hardware, software, or systems, network, firewalls, or infrastructure preventing normal Axiom usage;  
  * use by Customer of the Axiom Service not in strict compliance with the applicable Documentation;   
  * incidents caused by misuse, negligence, or unapproved modifications of Axiom Services;   
  * Unscheduled Downtime with respect to any Axiom Service made available on a no-fee or trial basis, or for which Customer has not paid to Axiom all of the applicable fees;  
  * Services clearly labelled “Preview”; and  
  * any issues resulting from changes to a Customer’s configuration of the Axiom Service (e.g., configuration changes related to BYOB or BYOC).

**“Incident**” means a failure to meet the applicable MUP due to Unscheduled Downtime.

### Service credits

If an Incident occurs with respect to Axiom Service , Customer may request credits with respect to such Axiom Service (“Credits”). To receive Credits, Customer must meet the following requirements: 

* Notify the Axiom support team within thirty (30) days of the date the Incident occurred with the following phrase in the title: “SLA Incident” (the “Notice”);

* Notice must include: logs and supporting information reasonably necessary for Axiom to confirm the SLA Issue; and dates and times with respect to the SLA Issue.

Once verified by Axiom, Credits will be issued as a percentage of Customer’s monthly (or prorated) bill for the affected Axiom Service. Customer acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding anything to the contrary: (a) the Credit is the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any SLA Issue; (b) the Credit may only be used by Customer to reduce the applicable monthly fees with respect to future payment obligations regarding the Axiom Service impacted by the Incident; (c) Credits may not be converted into cash, cash equivalents, or entitle Customer to a refund; (d) any unused Credits shall expire and be of no use following the expiration or termination of the applicable Service Order or the Agreement; and (e) Credits may not be used to reduce the applicable monthly fees by more than fifty percent (50%). 

The table below shows how Credits are calculated:

| Monthly Uptime Percentage  | Service Credit Percentage |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Axiom Cloud:** \< 99.9% but \>= 99.0%  | 10% |
| **Axiom Cloud:** \< 99.0% but \>= 95.0%  | 25% |
| **Axiom Cloud:** \< 95.0%  | 50% |

##  Priorities, support response times, and escalation

### Bug resolution

Axiom investigates all reported Issues. Axiom uses commercially reasonable efforts to fix or provide a workaround as set forth in this Service Quality document. If Axiom needs more time to address an Issue, Axiom will escalate internally and keep Customer informed regarding progress.

“Issue” means an incident that investigation reveals is caused by the Axiom Service’s failure to perform materially in accordance with the specifications set forth in the Documentation for such Axiom Service. An incident will not be classified as an Issue if (a) the relevant Axiom Service is not used for its intended purpose; (b) the incident is caused by Customer’s or a third party’s software or equipment; or (c) the version of the Axiom Service on which the Issue has purportedly occurred is not the most current version of such Axiom Service made available to Customer under the Agreement.

### Priority levels and escalation

Axiom offers **Standard** and **Premium** support. Standard support is included for all paying customers. Premium support is available as an add-on. Axiom classifies Issues by priority, ensuring faster responses and more frequent updates for critical issues.

| Priority | Description | Standard Response | Premium Response | Update Frequency |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Critical** (P1) | Issue results in complete system failure or critical business process disrupted. | 3 hours (24x7) | 1 hour (24x7) | Hourly |
| **High** (P2) | Issue results in partial system failures or disruptions to important business processes. | 1 business day | 4 hours (24x7) | Every 4 hours during business hours |
| **Medium** (P3) | Issue results in minor system failures or disruptions to non-critical business processes. | 2 business days | 1 business day | Weekly |
| **Low** (P4) | Issue results in minor issues or requests that do not significantly affect business operations. | 3 business days | 2 business days | On material updates |

For Critical, High, and Medium Issues that require additional attention, Axiom offers a tiered escalation process:

1. Technical Customer Support Engineer  
2. Head of Product  
3. VP of Engineering  
4. CTO

Escalations to these levels are not automatic but are considered based on the nature and urgency and impact of the Issue. Axiom’s support team will manage this process, ensuring that the right people are involved at the right time.

#### Escalating a request

* If your request is already being handled by Customer Support, reply in the existing support thread and request an escalation.  
* If you have a new request, write an email to [support@axiom.co](mailto:support@axiom.co) with "Escalation Request" in the subject line.

Our team monitors these channels closely and will respond promptly to escalation requests.

### Business hours

Axiom Customer Support is offered during business hours as set forth below:

* **Business hours**: 8:00 AM – 6:00 PM Eastern Time (US) on weekdays, excluding U.S. public holidays.  
* **EU support**: For EU-based requests, 8:00 AM – 6:00 PM ET on weekdays, excluding local public holidays.

## Incident management and communications

Axiom continuously monitors systems and has an on-call rotation that spans multiple time zones. For real-time visibility of incidents and maintenance, visit [status.axiom.co](https://status.axiom.co). In the event of **Critical** (P1) or **High** (P2) issues:

1. We will post updates to [status.axiom.co](https://status.axiom.co) (at least hourly during business hours).  
2. Once resolved, we will share a post-mortem for Critical (P1) issues detailing what happened, how we mitigated the Issue, and how we plan to prevent future Issues.

An Issue will be considered resolved when one of the following has been completed:

1. a resolution to the Issue is made available to Customer;
2. a computer software code change in the form of a patch or a new revision that corrects the Issue is made available to Customer;
3. a short-term workaround is made available to Customer; or
4. an engineering commitment is made to correct the Issue in a future release of the Axiom Service.

Axiom is not obligated to correct any Issue or issue that meets any of the following conditions:

1. where the Axiom Service is not used for its intended purpose; or
2. where the Axiom Service has been altered, damaged, modified in a manner not approved in writing by Axiom; or
3. where the Axiom Service is a version that is no longer supported by Axiom; or  
4. which is caused by Customer’s or a third party’s software, equipment, network or system;
5. which is caused by Customer’s negligence, abuse, misapplication, or use of the Axiom Service other than as specified in the Documentation; or 
6. which would be resolved by the Customer using an error correction or update regarding the Axiom Service.

Customer acknowledges that new features may be added to the Axiom Service based on market demand and technological innovation.  Accordingly, as Axiom develops enhanced versions of the Axiom Service, Axiom may cease to maintain and support older versions.
