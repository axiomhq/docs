Each feature of Axiom is in one of the following states:

- **In development:** Axiom is actively building this feature. It’s not available yet but it’s progressing towards Preview.
- **Private preview:** An early access feature available to selected customers which helps Axiom validate the feature with trusted partners.
- **Public preview:** The feature is available for everyone to try but may have some rough edges. Axiom is gathering feedback before making it GA.
- **Generally available (GA):** The feature is fully released, production-ready, and supported. Feel free to use it in your workflows.
- **Planned end of life:** The feature is scheduled to be retired. It’s still working but you should start migrating to alternative solutions.
- **End of life:** The feature is no longer available or supported. Axiom has sunset it in favor of newer solutions.

<Warning>
Private and public preview features are experimental, are not guaranteed to work as expected, and may return unexpected query results. Please consider the risk you run when you use preview features against production workloads.
