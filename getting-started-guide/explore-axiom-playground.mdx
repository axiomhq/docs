Axiom offers access to your event data without compromises: all your data, all the time, for all possible needs. Forget about data sampling, delays, or excessive costs.

This page explains how to try out Axiom without registration with the [Axiom Playground](https://play.axiom.co/). It walks you through an example where you run a website and you want to keep an overview of the HTTP requests to this site with Axiom.

To try out Axiom with sample data but without integrating it into your system, see [Getting started with Axiom](/getting-started-guide/getting-started).

To start integrating Axiom into your system, see [Start integrating Axiom into your system](/getting-started-guide/integrate-axiom).

## 1. Display stream of incoming data

1. Go to the [Axiom Playground](https://play.axiom.co/).
2. Click the **Stream** tab on the top of the page.
3. Click **sample-http-logs** in the list.

<RunInPlayGround 
    href="https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/stream/sample-http-logs" 
    target="_blank" 
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
/>

You see the data that Axiom receives realtime. In this example, this page displays the HTTP requests to your imaginary website.

## 2. Query data

1. Click the **Datasets** tab on the top of the page, and then click **sample-http-logs** in the list. This tab enables you to query your data with a visual query editor.
2. In the **Filter** section, click **+**.
3. Write **status == "500"**, and then press **Enter**.
4. Click **Run query**.

You see all the HTTP requests with the status **500**. This is important to know because this status indicates an internal server error, meaning that the server has encountered a situation that it can't handle.

## 3. Run an advanced query

1. Click the **Explore** tab on the top of the page, and then click **sample-http-logs** in the list. This tab enables you to query your data using the Axiom Processing Language (APL). For more information, see [Introduction to APL](/apl/introduction).
2. In the text field, enter the following:
    ```apl copy
    ['sample-http-logs']
    | summarize count() by bin_auto(_time), status
    ```
3. Click **Run query**.

You see the number of HTTP requests of each status over time.
