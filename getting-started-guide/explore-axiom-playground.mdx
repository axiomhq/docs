This page explains how to try out Axiom without registration with the [Axiom Playground](https://play.axiom.co/). It walks you through an example where you run a website and you want to keep an overview of the HTTP requests to this site with Axiom.

## 1. Explore sample data

1. Go to the [Axiom Playground](https://play.axiom.co/).
1. Click the **Datasets** tab at the top of the page.
1. In the list of datasets, click `sample-http-logs`.

This displays the fields in the sample dataset `sample-http-logs`. In Axiom, an individual piece of data is an event, and a dataset is a collection of similar events. In this example, an event is an HTTP request to your website, and the dataset holds incoming data about all these HTTP requests.

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/datasets/sample-http-logs)

## 2. Display stream of incoming data

1. Click the **Stream** tab at the top of the page.
1. Click **sample-http-logs** in the list.

You see the data that Axiom receives realtime. In this example, this page displays the HTTP requests to your imaginary website.

## 3. Analyze data

### Query data

1. Click the **Query** tab at the top of the page, and then click **Builder** in the top left. This enables you to query your data with a visual query builder.
1. In the **Dataset** section, select **sample-http-logs** from the list of datasets.
1. In the **Where** section, click **+**.
1. Write **status == "500"**, and then press **Enter**.
1. Click **Run**.

You see all the HTTP requests with the status 500. This is important to know because this status indicates an internal server error, meaning that the server has encountered a situation that it can’t handle.

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20where%20status%20%3D%3D%20'500'%22%7D)

### Run an APL query

1. Click the **Query** tab at the top of the page, and then click **APL** in the top left. This enables you to query your data with the Axiom Processing Language (APL). For more information, see [Introduction to APL](/apl/introduction).
1. In the text field, enter the following:
    ```kusto
    ['sample-http-logs']
    | summarize count() by bin_auto(_time), status
    ```
1. Click **Run**.

You see the number of HTTP requests of each status over time.

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20count()%20by%20bin_auto(_time)%2C%20status%22%7D)

## 4. Visualize data

1. Click the **Dashboards** tab at the top of the page.
1. Click **HTTP logs** in the list.

You see a dashboard that displays important information about the HTTP requests to the website.
