Axiom offers access to your event data without compromises: all your data, all the time, for all possible needs. Forget about data sampling, delays, or excessive costs.

This page explains how to try out Axiom without registration with the [Axiom Playground](https://play.axiom.co/). It walks you through an example where you run a website and you want to keep an overview of the HTTP requests to this site with Axiom.

To try out Axiom with sample data but without integrating it into your system, see [Quickstart using sample data](getting-started-guide/quickstart-using-sample-data).

To start integrating Axiom into your system, see [Integrate Axiom into your system](/getting-started-guide/integrate-axiom).

## 1. Display stream of incoming data

1. Go to the [Axiom Playground](https://play.axiom.co/).
1. Click the **Stream** tab on the top of the page.
1. Click **sample-http-logs** in the list.

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/stream/sample-http-logs)

You see the data that Axiom receives realtime. In this example, this page displays the HTTP requests to your imaginary website.

## 2. Query data

1. Click the **Query** tab on the top of the page, and then click **Builder** in the top left. This enables you to query your data with a visual query builder.
1. In the **Dataset** section, select **sample-http-logs** from the list of datasets.
1. In the **Where** section, click **+**.
1. Write **status == "500"**, and then press **Enter**.
1. Click **Run**.

You see all the HTTP requests with the status 500. This is important to know because this status indicates an internal server error, meaning that the server has encountered a situation that it can’t handle.

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20where%20status%20%3D%3D%20'500'%22%7D)

## 3. Run an APL query

1. Click the **Query** tab on the top of the page, and then click **APL** in the top left. This enables you to query your data with the Axiom Processing Language (APL). For more information, see [Introduction to APL](/apl/introduction).
1. In the text field, enter the following:
    ```kusto
    ['sample-http-logs']
    | summarize count() by bin_auto(_time), status
    ```
1. Click **Run**.

You see the number of HTTP requests of each status over time.

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20count()%20by%20bin_auto(_time)%2C%20status%22%7D)

## 4. Visualize data

1. Click the **Dashboards** tab on the top of the page.
1. Click **Http logs** in the list.

You see a dashboard that displays important information about the HTTP requests to the website.
