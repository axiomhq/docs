In Axiom, event data is the atomic unit of activity, encompassing logs, traces, and even product interactions. Each event is simply a structured record—composed of key-value pairs—that captures meaningful interactions or changes in state within a system. While these can appear in various forms, from log lines to complex traces, they usually contain the following:

- **Timestamp**: When the event occurred.
- **Attributes**: A set of key-value pairs offering details about the event context.
- **Metadata**: Contextual labels and IDs, such as trace ID and span ID, that connect related events.

Rather than simply calling them logs or metrics, event data reflects a broader range of interactions, crossing boundaries from engineering to product management, security, and beyond. This includes everything from the number of documents created in a product to the sequence of API calls during a checkout process.

## Types of event data

Traditionally, observability has been associated with three pillars, each effectively a specialized view of event data:

- **Logs**: Logs record discrete events, such as error messages or access requests, typically associated with engineering or security.
- **Traces**: Traces track the path of requests through a system, capturing each step’s duration. By linking related spans within a trace, developers can identify bottlenecks and dependencies.
- **Metrics**: Metrics quantify state over time, recording data like CPU usage or user count at intervals. Product or engineering teams can then monitor and aggregate these values for performance insights.

In Axiom, these observability elements are stored as event data, allowing for fine-grained, efficient tracking across all three pillars.

## Metrics support

Axiom excels at collecting, storing, and analyzing timestamped event data.

For logs and traces, Axiom offers unparalleled efficiency and query performance.

For metrics data, Axiom is well-suited for event-level metrics that behave like logs, with each data point representing a discrete event. 

For example, you have the following timestamped data in Axiom:

```json
{
  "job_id": "train_123",
  "user_name": "acme",
  "timestamp": "2024-10-08T15:30:00Z",
  "node_host": "worker-01",
  "metric_name": "gpu_utilization",
  "metric_value": 87.5,
  "training_type": "image_classification"
}
```

You can easily query and analyze this type of metrics data in Axiom. The query below computes the average GPU utilization across nodes:

```kusto
dataset
| summarize avg(metric_value) by node_host, bin_auto(_time)
```

Axiom’s support for metrics data currently comes with the following limitations:
- Axiom doesn’t support pre-aggregated metrics such as scrape samples.
- Axiom isn’t optimized for high-dimensionality metric timeseries with a very large number of metric/label combinations.

Support for these types of metrics data is coming soon in the first half of 2025.
