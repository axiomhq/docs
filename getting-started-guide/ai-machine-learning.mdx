Axiom allows you to monitor, evaluate, and iterate on AI models in production.

As machine learning (ML) becomes central to user-facing applications, the challenge is no longer just building and deploying models, but improving them in production.

Axiom enables ML and product engineering teams to continuously monitor and improve AI models in production by closing the loop between real-world data, model behavior, and iteration workflows. We integrate with your existing ML stack—such as Databricks, SageMaker, or Modal to surface failures, detect drift, and validate improvements without adding unnecessary complexity.

## Why event data matters in AI and machine learning

Shipping an AI model is only the beginning. The real challenge starts when it’s live and interacting with real users. Issues like hallucinations, bias, or degraded accuracy can damage user trust or experience. While many teams can detect that a model failed, very few can easily isolate the root cause, test a fix using production data, and confidently re-ship without days of manual effort.

## Key features of Axiom for AI and machine learning

With Axiom, you can solve the issues mentioned above:

- **Capture and replay real-world inference data:** Automatically sample or flag production inputs and outputs to create test scenarios based on actual usage, not synthetic data.
- **Compare model versions at scale:** Run side-by-side tests between current and proposed model versions using real production slices. Visualize regressions, improvements, and unintended changes.
- **Orchestrate model updates confidently:** Integrate with your model orchestrator to re-deploy tested improvements with a few clicks, without pipeline rewrites required.
- **Shorten iteration cycles:** Reduce iteration time from days to hours by eliminating manual steps like downloading logs, writing scripts, or rebuilding test cases.

| Role               | Problem                                                                | What Axiom offers                                                       |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ML engineers       | Debugging and testing are slow and manual                              | Automate capture and replay of inference data for quick validation      |
| Applied AI teams   | Hard to measure impact of model changes in production                  | Run version comparisons with real production examples                   |
| Product engineers  | Limited visibility into model behavior post-deployment                 | See and test how real users are affected in production                  |

## How Axiom works for AI and machine learning

Axiom introduces a closed-loop workflow that integrates with your current ML infrastructure:

1. **Detect:** Automatically surface anomalous, drifting, or low-confidence outputs in production.
1. **Sample:** Capture relevant inputs and outputs to build test cases from real-world examples.
1. **Validate:** Run tests against current and new model versions. Inspect where improvements or regressions occur.
1. **Ship:** Re-deploy the improved model confidently using built-in orchestration tools.

This process lets you maintain a rapid feedback loop between observe, refine, re-ship.

## Why choose Axiom for AI and machine learning

Axiom is perfect for iteration on live usage data. It fits naturally into modern stacks without forcing major changes.

You’ll benefit most if you:

- Already have models in production.
- Discover issues late via user complaints or delayed log review.
- Manually gather logs and write ad hoc scripts to test model fixes.
- Want to tighten the iteration loop for faster, more confident updates.
