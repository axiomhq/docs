Axiom helps you leverage the power of timestamped event data. Axiom believes that event data reflects a broad range of interactions, crossing boundaries from engineering to product management, security, and beyond. For a more general explanation of event data in Axiom, see [Events](/getting-started-guide/event-data).

This page explains how you can leverage the power of event data for the security use case. For more information on what Axiom does to ensure the highest standards of information security and data protection, see [Security](/reference/security).

Security teams need fast, flexible access to data across a variety of platforms and tools to stay ahead of potential risks. Axiom empowers security professionals to harness the power of timestamped event data to detect, investigate, and respond to security threats with greater speed and precision. The following introduces you to some of Axiom’s advanced features such as dataset and dashboard sharing, joins, and lookups can significantly enhance security operations.

## Seamless data sharing across organizations

Security incidents don’t happen in isolation. Effective threat detection and response often require collaboration across different teams or even different organizations. Axiom simplifies this process by enabling easy sharing of datasets and dashboards. Whether it’s an internal security operation or a cross-organization security coalition, Axiom ensures that the right people have access to the right data when they need it.

Security teams can create specific datasets containing event logs, alerts, or anomaly reports and securely share them with relevant stakeholders. This is particularly useful when teams need to collaborate on an ongoing investigation, share findings with external partners or third-party vendors, or review historical data for post-incident analysis. By reducing the friction involved in data sharing, Axiom ensures that security teams stay aligned, making responses faster and more effective.

## Join data for deeper insights

Security events often involve multiple systems, services, and platforms. In a typical security stack, data is often siloed across various tools such as SIEMs, network monitoring solutions, and endpoint security software. Axiom’s join functionality enables you to combine disparate datasets into a single, unified view.

For instance, suppose you’re investigating an alert generated by your firewall. Axiom allows you to seamlessly join that firewall event data with endpoint logs, authentication records, or even application activity. This capability can help you quickly correlate events, track suspicious behaviors across systems, and paint a clearer picture of potential security threats. In security, context is everything, and Axiom’s powerful join operations make it easy to stitch together data from multiple sources to see the full story.

Moreover, security teams can use joins to enrich event data with additional context, such as user roles, device information, or geolocation data, which can help prioritize responses and ensure the right actions are taken based on the severity of the threat.

## Efficient lookups for real-time analysis

In fast-paced security environments, time is of the essence. Security analysts often need to quickly enrich event data with additional context, such as user attributes, IP reputation, or threat intelligence feeds, in order to make informed decisions. Axiom’s lookup functionality simplifies this process by enabling real-time enrichment of your datasets with external data sources.

For example, a security analyst might be investigating suspicious login activity. With Axiom’s lookup feature, they can instantly query external data sources (for example, threat intelligence platforms and internal user databases) to enrich the event with relevant information, such as whether the user is on a watchlist or whether the login attempt is coming from a known malicious IP address. This real-time lookup capability allows security teams to act swiftly and accurately, without having to manually search through multiple platforms.

By leveraging lookups, security teams can automate many of their enrichment workflows, freeing up time for more strategic analysis and decision-making. Whether responding to alerts, conducting proactive threat hunting, or preparing for a compliance audit, the ability to quickly access enriched data is invaluable.

## Why choose Axiom for security

Axiom’s emerging abilities to share datasets, join data from different sources, and perform real-time lookups are crucial for security teams. With these features, security professionals can gain deeper insights into their event data, collaborate more effectively across organizations, and respond to threats with greater agility. By centralizing and streamlining the analysis of timestamped event data, Axiom enables security teams to stay one step ahead in the fight against cyber threats.
