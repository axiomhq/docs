This page explains how to try out Axiom with sample data. It walks you through an example where you want to keep track of OpenTelemetry (OTel) traces with Axiom.

By following this page, you will:

1. Explore the structure of sample data.
1. Display a stream of incoming data.
1. Analyze the data.
1. Visualize the data by creating a simple dashboard.
1. Set up a monitor that alerts you about internal server errors.

To try out Axiom without registration, see [Explore Axiom Playground](/getting-started-guide/explore-axiom-playground).

## 1. Explore sample data

1. [Sign up for an Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/register). All you need is an email address.
1. Click the **Datasets** tab at the top of the page.
1. In the list of datasets, click `otel-demo-traces`.

This displays the fields in the sample dataset `otel-demo-traces`.

## 2. Display stream of incoming data

1. Click the **Stream** tab at the top of the page.
1. Click **otel-demo-traces** in the list.

You see the data that Axiom receives realtime.

## 3. Analyze data

### Query data

1. Click the **Query** tab at the top of the page, and then click **Builder** in the top left. This enables you to query your data with a visual query builder.
1. In the **Dataset** section, select **otel-demo-traces** from the list of datasets.
1. In the **Where** section, click **+**.
1. Write **service.name == frontend**, and then press **Enter**.
1. Click **Run**.

You see all the traces for the Frontend service.

### Run an APL query

1. Click the **Query** tab at the top of the page, and then click **APL** in the top left. This enables you to query your data with the Axiom Processing Language (APL). For more information, see [Introduction to APL](/apl/introduction).
1. In the text field, enter the following:
    ```kusto
    ['otel-demo-traces']
    | where duration > 5ms
    | summarize count() by bin_auto(_time), ['service.name']
    ```
1. Click **Run**.

You see the number of requests taking longer than 5 ms for each service over time.

## 4. Visualize data

1. Click the **Dashboards** tab at the top of the page.
1. Click **OpenTelemetry Traces (otel-demo-traces)** in the list.

You see a dashboard that displays important information about the OTel traces.

## 5. Create new dashboard

1. Click the **Dashboards** tab at the top of the page, and then click **New dashboard** on the right.
1. Name the dashboard and click **Create**.
1. Click **Add a chart**, and then click **Timeseries**.
1. In the **Dataset** section, select **otel-demo-traces**.
1. In the **Summarize** section, click **no group** to the right of **by**, and then select **service.name**.
1. Click **Save**.

You created a simple dashboard that displays the number of requests for each service over time.

## 6. Monitor data for issues

### Create notifier

1. Click the **Monitors** tab at the top of the page.
1. In the top left, click **Notifiers**, and then click **New notifier** on the top right.
1. In **Name**, enter **Slow requests notifier**.
1. In **Users**, enter your email address, and then click **+** on the right.
1. Click **Create**.

### Create monitor

1. In the top left, click **Monitors**, and then click **New monitor** on the top right.
1. Click **Threshold monitor**.
1. In **Check options**, enter `10000` as the value.
1. Click **+ Add notifier**, and then select **Email: Slow requests notifier**.
1. In the **APL** section, enter the following:
    ```kusto
    ['otel-demo-traces']
    | where duration > 5ms
    | summarize count() by bin(_time, 1m)
    ```
1. Click **Create**.

You created a monitor that automatically sends a notification to your email address if the number of requests taking longer than 5 ms is higher than 10,000 during a one minute period.
