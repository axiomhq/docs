Axiom enables you to query your event data without compromises: all your data, all the time, for all possible needs. No sampling, no waiting, and no extravagant bills.

This page explains how to try out Axiom with sample data. It walks you through an example where you run a website and you want to keep an overview of the HTTP requests to this site with Axiom.

By following this page, you will:

1. Explore the structure of sample data.
1. Display stream of incoming data.
1. Analyze the data.
1. Visualize the data by creating a simple dashboard.
1. Set up a monitor that alerts you about internal server errors.

To try out Axiom without registration, go to the [Axiom Playground](https://play.axiom.co/). For more information on how to navigate the Playground, see [Try out Axiom without registration](/getting-started-guide/explore-axiom-playground).

To start integrating Axiom into your system, see [Integrate Axiom into your system](/getting-started-guide/integrate-axiom).

## 1. Explore sample data

1. [Sign up for an Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/register). All you need is an email address.
1. Click the **Datasets** tab on the top of the page.
1. In the list of datasets, click `sample-http-logs`.

This displays the fields in the sample dataset `sample-http-logs`. In Axiom, an individual piece of data is an event, and a dataset is a collection of similar events. In this example, an event is an HTTP request to your website, and the dataset holds incoming data about all these HTTP requests.

## 2. Display stream of incoming data

1. Click the **Stream** tab on the top of the page.
2. Click **sample-http-logs** in the list.

You see the data that Axiom receives realtime. In this example, this page displays the HTTP requests to your imaginary website.

## 3. Analyze data

### Query data

1. Click the **Query** tab on the top of the page, and then click **Builder** in the top left. This enables you to query your data with a visual query builder.
1. In the **Dataset** section, select **sample-http-logs** from the list of datasets.
1. In the **Where** section, click **+**.
1. Write **status == "500"**, and then press **Enter**.
1. Click **Run**.

You see all the HTTP requests with the status 500. This is important to know because this status indicates an internal server error, meaning that the server has encountered a situation that it canâ€™t handle.

### Run an APL query

1. Click the **Query** tab on the top of the page, and then click **APL** in the top left. This enables you to query your data with the Axiom Processing Language (APL). For more information, see [Introduction to APL](/apl/introduction).
1. In the text field, enter the following:
    ```kusto
    ['sample-http-logs']
    | summarize count() by bin_auto(_time), status
    ```
1. Click **Run**.

You see the number of HTTP requests of each status over time.

## 4. Visualize data

1. Click the **Dashboards** tab on the top of the page.
1. Click **Http logs** in the list.

You see a dashboard that displays important information about the HTTP requests to the website.

## 5. Create new dashboard

1. Click the **Dashboards** tab on the top of the page, and then click **New dashboard** on the right.
1. Name the dashboard and click **Create**.
1. Click **Add a chart**, and then click **Timeseries**.
1. In the **Dataset** section, select **sample-http-logs**.
1. In the **Summarize** section, click **no group** to the right of **by**, and then select **status**.
1. Click **Save**.

You created a simple dashboard that displays the number of HTTP requests of each status over time.

## 6. Monitor data for issues

### Create notifier

1. Click the **Monitors** tab on the top of the page.
1. In the top left, click **Notifiers**, and then click **New notifier** on the top right.
1. In **Name**, enter **Internal server error notifier**.
1. In **Users**, enter your email address, and then click **+** on the right.
1. Click **Create**.

### Create monitor

1. In the top left, click **Monitors**, and then click **New monitor** on the top right.
1. Click **Threshold monitor**.
1. In **Check options**, enter `1000` as the value.
1. Click **+ Add notifier**, and then select **Email: Internal server error notifier**.
1. Click **Builder**.
1. In the **APL** section, enter the following:
    ```kusto
    ['sample-http-logs']
    | where status == "500"
    | summarize count() by bin_auto(_time)
    ```
1. Click **Create**.

You created a monitor that automatically sends a notification to your email address if the HTTP requests with the status **500** is higher than 1,000 in ten minutes.
