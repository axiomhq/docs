Axiom enables you to query your event data without compromises: all your data, all the time, for all possible needs. No sampling, no waiting, and no extravagant bills.

This page explains how to try out Axiom with sample data. It walks you through an example where you run a website and you want to keep an overview of the HTTP requests to this site with Axiom.

By following this page, you will:

1. Send sample data to Axiom.
2. Analyze the data.
3. Visualize the data by creating a simple dashboard.
4. Set up a monitor that alerts you about internal server errors.

To try out Axiom without registration, go to the [Axiom Playground](https://play.axiom.co/). For more information on how to navigate the Playground, see [Try out Axiom without registration](/getting-started-guide/explore-axiom-playground).

## 1. Send data to Axiom

1. [Sign up for an Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/register). All you need is an email address.
2. Click **Create dataset**.
3. Name your dataset **sample-http-logs**, and then click **Add**.
4. Click **Send sample data to this dataset**.

This creates a dataset in your account. In Axiom, an individual piece of data is an event, and a dataset is a collection of similar events. In this example, an event is an HTTP request to your website, and the dataset holds incoming data about all these HTTP requests.

## 2. Analyze data

### Display stream of incoming data

1. Click the **Stream** tab on the top of the page.
2. Click **sample-http-logs** in the list.

You see the data that Axiom receives realtime. In this example, this page displays the HTTP requests to your imaginary website.

### Query data

1. Click the **Datasets** tab on the top of the page, and then click **sample-http-logs**. This tab enables you to query your data with a visual query editor.
2. In the **Filter** section, click **+**.
3. Write **status == "500"**, and then press **Enter**.
4. Click **Run query**.

You see all the HTTP requests with the status **500**. This is important to know because this status indicates an internal server error, meaning that the server has encountered a situation that it can't handle.

### Run an advanced query

1. Click the **Explore** tab on the top of the page, and then click your dataset. This tab enables you to query your data using the Axiom Processing Language (APL). For more information, see [Introduction to APL](/apl/introduction).
2. In the text field, enter the following:
    ```apl copy
    ['sample-http-logs']
    | summarize count() by bin_auto(_time), status
    ```
3. Click **Run query**.

You see the number of HTTP requests of each status over time.

## 3. Visualize data

1. Click the **Dashboards** tab on the top of the page, and then click **New dashboard** on the right.
2. Name the dashboard and click **Create**.
3. Click **Add a chart**, and then click **Simple Query Builder**.
4. In **Dataset**, select **sample-http-logs**.
5. To the right of **Group by**, click **+**, and then select **status**.
6. Click **Save**.

You created a simple dashboard that displays the number of HTTP requests of each status over time.

## 4. Monitor data for issues

1. Click the **Monitors** tab on the top of the page, and then click **Manage notifiers** on the right.
2. Click **New notifier** on the top right.
3. In **Name**, enter **Internal server error notifier**.
4. In **Users**, enter your email address, and then click **+** on the right.
5. Click **Create**, and then click **Done**.
6. Click **New monitor**.
7. Click **Add notifier**, and then select **Internal server error notifier**.
8. click **Simple Query Builder**.
9. In **Dataset**, select **sample-http-logs**.
10. In the **Filter** section, click **+**.
11. Write **status == "500"**, and then press **Enter**.
12. Click **Create**.

You created a monitor that automatically sends a notification to your email address if the HTTP requests with the status **500** is higher than 1,000 in ten minutes.
