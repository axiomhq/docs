Axiom enables you to query your event data without compromises: all your data, all the time, for all possible needs. No sampling, no waiting, and no extravagant bills.

This page explains how to try out Axiom with an example Node.js app that emits OpenTelemetry trace data. There are many others ways you can send data to Axiom. For a full list, see [Send data](/send-data/ingest).

To try out Axiom without registration, go to the [Axiom Playground](https://play.axiom.co/). For more information on how to navigate the Playground, see [Explore Axiom Playground](/getting-started-guide/explore-axiom-playground).

To connect Axiom to your system, see [Integrate Axiom into your system](/getting-started-guide/integrating-axiom).

## 1. Set up Axiom

To set up Axiom to receive data, first [sign up for a free Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/register). All you need is an email address.

### Create a dataset

In Axiom, an individual piece of data is an event, and a dataset is a collection of similar events. In this example, events are emitted by the sample app, and the dataset contains the incoming event data.

1. Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Datasets**, and then click **New dataset**.
2. Name your dataset **test-dataset**, and then click **Add**.

This creates a dataset in your account where you will send event data.

### Create an API token

An API token is a form of authentication that enables you to send data to Axiom. Keep it confidential because anyone with this key can send data to your Axiom dataset.

1. Click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > API tokens**, and then click **New API token**.
2. Name your API token **test-token**.
3. In **Dataset access**, select **test-dataset**.
4. Click **Add**.
5. Copy the API token that appears and store it securely. It won't be displayed again.

This creates an API token that you will use to authenticate requests to send data to Axiom.

## 2. Send data to Axiom

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Clone the [`otlp-exporter-node` example from OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/main/examples/otlp-exporter-node).
3. In the `tracing.js` file, edit the code that creates the `OTLPTraceExporter` object. Replace `AXIOM_API_TOKEN` with the Axiom API token you have generated.

    ```js
    const exporter = new OTLPTraceExporter({
        url: 'https://api.axiom.co/v1/traces',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer AXIOM_API_TOKEN',
          'X-Axiom-Dataset': 'test-dataset'
        },
    });
    ```

4. In your terminal, go to the root folder of the example app. Run the following to install dependencies and start the app three times:

    ```shell
    npm i
    npm run start:tracing
    npm run start:tracing
    npm run start:tracing
    ```

This connects the example app to Axiom. Every time the app runs, it sends event data to Axiom.

## 3. Analyze data

### Display stream of incoming data

1. Click the **Stream** tab on the top of the page.
2. Click **test-dataset** in the list.

You see the event data that Axiom receives realtime.

### Query data

1. Click the **Datasets** tab on the top of the page, and then click **test-dataset**. This tab enables you to query your data with a visual query editor.
2. In the **Visualize** section, click **+**.
3. Write `histogram(duration, 15)`, and then press **Enter**.
4. Click **Run query**.

You see a heatmap of events and their duration.

### Run a query with Axiom Processing Language (APL)

1. Click the **Explore** tab on the top of the page, and then click your dataset. This tab enables you to query your data using the Axiom Processing Language (APL). For more information, see [Introduction to APL](/apl/introduction).
2. In the text field, enter the following:
    ```apl copy
    ['test-dataset']
    | where duration > 1000000
    | take 1000
    ```
3. Click **Run query**.

You see the events that took longer than 1 ms. In the query above, you see one million because time in the `duration` field is stored in nanoseconds.

## 4. Visualize data

1. Click the **Dashboards** tab on the top of the page, and then click **OpenTelemetry Traces (test-dataset)**. You see data about incoming traces and spans. Whenever Axiom detects known schemas like OpenTelemetry, it automatically creates dashboards for you.
2. The `Slowest Operations` chart shows the list of services. Click `basic-service` to display the traces of this service.
3. Click one of the traces in the list.

You see a waterfall view of spans that displays each span in the trace and their duration.

## 5. Monitor data for issues

### Create a notifier

Set up a notifier to determine the channel Axiom uses to alert you about what's happening with your data. For example, Axiom can send you an email.

1. Click the **Monitors** tab on the top of the page, and then click **Manage notifiers** on the right.
2. Click **New notifier** on the top right.
3. In **Name**, enter **test-notifier**.
4. In **Users**, enter your email address, and then click **+** on the right.
5. Click **Create**, and then click **Done**.

### Create a monitor

Set up a monitor to receive alerts if certain conditions about your event data are met.

1. Click the **Monitors** tab on the top of the page, and then click **New monitor**.
2. Click **Add notifier**, and then select **Email: test-notifier**.
3. Click **Simple Query Builder**.
4. In **Dataset**, select **test-dataset**.
5. Click **Create**.

You created a monitor that automatically sends a notification to your email address if the number of events Axiom receives is higher than 1,000 in ten minutes.
