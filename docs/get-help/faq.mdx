# Frequently Asked Questions

This page aims to offer a deeper understanding of Axiom. If you cannot find an answer to your questions, please feel free to  [contact our team](mailto:support@axiom.co).

## What is Axiom?

Axiom is a log management and analytics solution that reduces the cost and management overhead of logging as much data as you want.

With Axiom, organizations no longer need to choose between their data and their costs. Axiom has been built from the ground-up to allow for highly efficient data ingestion and storage, and then a zero-to-infinite query scaling that allows you to query all your data, all the time.

Organizations use Axiom for continuous monitoring and observability, as well as an event store for running analytics and deriving insights from all their event data.

Axiom consists of a datastore and a user-experience that work in tandem to provide a completely unique log-management and analytics experience.

## Can I run Axiom in my own cloud/infrastructure?

Axiom enables you to store data in your own storage with the Bring Your Own Bucket (BYOB) feature. You provide your own S3-compatible object storage, and the Axiom control plane handles ingest, query execution, and all other background tasks. This is not an on-premises solution, but it enables you to maintain control over your data at rest.

Using Axiom as a cloud SaaS product without the BYOB option is safe, affordable, and the best choice for most use cases. Billed month-to-month on our [Team plan](/pricing) for ingest workloads up to 50TB/mo, and with no upper limit on our annual [Enterprise plan](/pricing), Axiom supports tens of thousands of organizations today. However, if you are a large enterprise customer and your organization requires data sovereignty for compliance reasons or secondary workloads, using Axiom with the BYOB premium option is the answer.

Axiom BYOB is available exclusively on our annual [Enterprise plan](/pricing).

## How is Axiom different than other logging solutions?

At Axiom, our goal is that no organization has to ignore or delete a single piece of data no matter its source: logs, events, frontend, backends, audits, etc.

We found that existing solutions would place restrictions on how much data can be collected either on purpose or as a side-effect of their architectures.

For example, “state of the art” in logging is running stateful clusters that need shared knowledge of ingestion and will use a mixture of local SSD-based storage and remote object storage.

### Side-effects of legacy vendors

1. There is a non-trivial cost in increasing your data ingest as clusters need to be scaled and more SSD storage and IOPs need to be provided

2. The choice needs to be made between hot and cold data, and also what is archived. Now your data is in 2-3 different places and queries can be fast or slow depending on where the data is

The end result is needing to carefully consider all data that is ingested, and putting limits and/or sampling to control the DevOps and cost burden.

### The ways Axiom is different

1. Decoupled ingest and querying pipelines

2. Stateless ingest pipeline that requires minimal compute/memory to storage as much as 1.5TB/day per vCPU

3. Ingests all data into object storage, enabling the cheapest storage possible for all ingested data

4. Enables querying scale-out with cloud functions, requiring no constantly-running servers waiting for a query to be processed. Instead, enjoy zero-to-infinity querying instantly

### The benefits of Axiom’s approach

1. The most efficient ingestion pipeline for massive amounts of data

2. Store more data for less by exclusively using inexpensive object storage for all data

3. Query data that’s 10 milliseconds or 10 years old at any time

4. Reduce the total cost of ownership of your log management and analytics pipelines with simple scale and maintenance that Axiom provides

5. Free your organization to do more with it’s data

## How long can I retain data for with Axiom?

Axiom’s free forever [Personal plan](/pricing) provides a generous 30 days of retention.

Axiom’s [Team plan](/pricing) provides 95 days of retention, ensuring a complete picture of your data for over 3 months.

Retention on Axiom’s [Enterprise plan](/pricing) can be customised to your needs, with the option for unlimited retention so your organization has access to all its data, all the time.

## Can I try Axiom for free?

Yes. Axiom’s [Personal plan](/pricing) is free forever with a generous allowance, and is available to all customers.

With unlimited users included, Axiom’s [Team plan](/pricing) starting at $25/mo is a great choice for growing companies, and for Enterprise organizations who want to run a proof-of-concept.

## How is Axiom licensed?

Axiom’s [Team plan](/pricing) is billed on a monthly basis.

Axiom’s [Enterprise plan](/pricing) is billed on an annual basis, with license details tailored to your organization’s needs.
