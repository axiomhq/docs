# Vercel Integration

Connect Axiom with Vercel to get the deepest observability experience for your Vercel projects.

Easily monitor data from requests, functions, and web vitals in one place. 100% live and 100% of your data, no sampling.

Axiom's Vercel integration ships with a pre-built dashboard and pre-installed monitors so you can be in complete control of your projects with minimal effort.

## What is Vercel

Vercel is a platform for frontend frameworks and static sites, built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database.

Vercel provides a frictionless developer experience to take care of the hard things: deploying instantly, scaling automatically, and serving personalized content around the globe.

Vercel makes it easy for frontend teams to develop, preview, and ship delightful user experiences, where performance is the default.

## Sending logs to Axiom

Simply install the [Axiom Vercel integration from here](https://vercel.com/integrations/axiom) and be streaming logs and web vitals within minutes!

## Integration Overview

### Request and Function Logs

For both requests and serverless functions, Axiom automatically installs a [log drain](https://vercel.com/blog/log-drains) in your Vercel account to capture data live.

As users interact with your website, various logs will be produced. Axiom captures all these logs and ingests them into the `vercel` dataset. You can stream and analyze these logs live, or use our pre-build Vercel Dashboard to get an overview of all the important metrics. When you're ready, you can fork our dashboard and start building your own!

For function logs, if you call `console.log`, `console.warn` or `console.error` in your function, the output will also be captured and made available as part of the log. You can use our extended query language, APL, to easily search these logs.

## Web vitals

Axiom supports capturing and analyzing Web Vital data directly from your user's browser without any sampling and with more data than is available elsewhere. It is perfect to pair with Vercel's in-built analytics when you want to get really deep into a specific problem or debug issues with a specific audience (user-agent, location, region, etc).

**NOTE: Web Vitals are only currently supported for Next.js websites. Expanded support is coming soon!**

#### Installation

Perform the following steps to install Web Vitals:

1. In your Vercel project, run `npm install --save next-axiom`.
2. In `next.config.js`, wrap your NextJS config in `withAxiom` as follows:

```js copy
const { withAxiom } = require('next-axiom');

module.exports = withAxiom({
  // ... your existing config
})
```
This will proxy the Axiom ingest call to improve deliverability.


3. For Web Vitals, navigate to `app/layout.tsx` and add the `AxiomWebVitals` component:

```js copy
import { AxiomWebVitals } from 'next-axiom';

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <html>
      ...
      <AxiomWebVitals />
      <div>...</div>
    </html>
  );
}
```

**Note:** WebVitals are sent only from production deployments.

4. Deploy your site and watch data coming into your Axiom dashboard.

- To send logs from different parts of your application, make use of the provided logging functions. For example:

```js
log.info('Payment completed', { userID: '123', amount: '25USD' });
```

### Client Components 

For Client Components, replace the `log` prop usage with the `useLogger` hook:

```js
'use client';
import { useLogger } from 'next-axiom';

export default function ClientComponent() {
  const log = useLogger();
  log.debug('User logged in', { userId: 42 });
  return <h1>Logged in</h1>;
}
```

### Server Components 

For Server Components, create a logger and make sure to call flush before returning:

```js
import { Logger } from 'next-axiom';

export default async function ServerComponent() {
  const log = new Logger();
  log.info('User logged in', { userId: 42 });

  // ... other operations ...

  await log.flush();
  return <h1>Logged in</h1>;
}
```

### Route Handlers

For Route Handlers, wrapping your Route Handlers in `withAxiom` will add a logger to your request and automatically log exceptions:

```js
import { withAxiom, AxiomRequest } from 'next-axiom';

export const GET = withAxiom((req: AxiomRequest) => {
  req.log.info('Login function called');

  // You can create intermediate loggers
  const log = req.log.with({ scope: 'user' });
  log.info('User logged in', { userId: 42 });

  return NextResponse.json({ hello: 'world' });
});
```

## Using Next.js 12 for Web Vitals

If you're using Next.js version 12, follow the instructions below to integrate Axiom for logging and capturing Web Vitals data.


In your `pages/_app.js` or `pages/_app.ts` and add the following line:

```js
export { reportWebVitals } from 'next-axiom';
```

## Upgrading to Next.js 13 from Next.js 12

If you plan on upgrading to Next.js 13, you'll need to make specific changes to ensure compatibility:

- Upgrade the next-axiom package to version `1.0.0` or higher:
- Make sure any exported variables have the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix`, e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_AXIOM_TOKEN`.
- In client components, use the `useLogger` hook instead of the `log` prop.
- For server-side components, you need to create an instance of the `Logger` and flush the logs before the component returns.
- For Web Vitals tracking, you'll replace the previous method of capturing data. Remove the `reportWebVitals()` line and instead integrate the `AxiomWebVitals` component into your layout.



## Vercel Function logs 4KB limit 

The Vercel 4KB log limit refers to a restriction placed by Vercel on the size of log output generated by serverless functions running on their platform. The 4KB log limit means that each log entry produced by your function should be at most 4 Kilobytes in size.

If your log output is larger than 4KB, you might experience truncation or missing logs. To log above this limit, you can send your function logs using [next-axiom](https://github.com/axiomhq/next-axiom).


## Parse JSON on the message field

If you use a logging library in your Vercel project that prints JSON, your **message** field will contain a stringified and therefore escaped JSON object.

- If your Vercel logs are encoded as JSON, they will look like this:

```json copy
{
  "level": "error",
  "message": "{ \"message\": \"user signed in\", \"metadata\": { \"userId\": 2234, \"signInType\": \"sso-google\" }}",
  "request": {
    "host": "www.axiom.co",
    "id": "iad1:iad1::sgh2r-1655985890301-f7025aa764a9",
    "ip": "199.16.157.13",
    "method": "GET",
    "path": "/sign-in/google",
    "scheme": "https",
    "statusCode": 500,
    "teamName": "AxiomHQ",
  },
  "vercel": {
    "deploymentId": "dpl_7UcdgdgNsdgbcPY3Lg6RoXPfA6xbo8",
    "deploymentURL": "axiom-bdsgvweie6au-axiomhq.vercel.app",
    "projectId": "prj_TxvF2SOZdgdgwJ2OBLnZH2QVw7f1Ih7",
    "projectName": "axiom-co",
    "region": "iad1",
    "route": "/signin/[id]",
    "source": "lambda-log"
  }
}
```

- The **JSON** data in your **message** would be: 

```json copy
{
  "message": "user signed in",
  "metadata": {
    "userId": 2234,
    "signInType": "sso-google"
   }
}
```

---


You can **parse** the JSON using the [parse_json function](/docs/apl/scalar-functions/string-functions#parse-json()) and run queries against the **values** in the **message** field.

### Example 

```apl copy
['vercel']
| extend parsed = parse_json(message)
```

- You can select the field to **insert** into new columns using the [project operator](/docs/apl/tabular-operators/project-operator)

```apl copy
['vercel']
| extend parsed = parse_json('{"message":"user signed in", "metadata": { "userId": 2234, "SignInType": "sso-google" }}')
| project parsed["message"]
```

---

### More Examples

- If you have **null values** in your data you can use the **isnotnull()** function

```apl copy
['vercel']
| extend parsed = parse_json(message)
| where isnotnull(parsed)
| summarize count() by parsed["message"], parsed["metadata"]["userId"]
```
