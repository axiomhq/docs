Integrate Axiom with Netlify to get a comprehensive observability experience for your Netlify projects. This integration will give you a better understanding of how your Jamstack apps are performing.

You can easily monitor logs and metrics related to your website traffic, serverless functions, and app requests. The integration is easy to set up, and you don't need to configure anything to get started.

With Axiom’s Zero-Config Observability app, you can see all your metrics in real-time, without sampling. That means you can get a complete view of your app’s performance without any gaps in data.

Axiom’s Netlify app is complete with a pre-built dashboard that gives you control over your Jamstack projects. You can use this dashboard to track key metrics and make informed decisions about your app’s performance.

Overall, the Axiom Netlify app makes it easy to monitor and optimize your Jamstack apps. However, do note that this integration is only available for Netlify customers enterprise-level plans where [Log Drains are supported](https://docs.netlify.com/monitor-sites/log-drains/).

## App overview

### Traffic and function Logs

With Axiom, you can instrument, and actively monitor your Netlify sites, stream your build logs, and analyze your deployment process, or use our pre-build Netlify Dashboard to get an overview of all the important traffic data, usage, and metrics. Various logs will be produced when users collaborate and interact with your sites and websites hosted on Netlify. Axiom captures and ingests all these logs into the `netlify` dataset.

You can also drill down to your site source with our advanced query language and fork our dashboard to start building your own site monitors.

- Back in your Axiom datasets console you'll see all your traffic and function logs in your `netlify` dataset.
