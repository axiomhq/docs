## Prerequisites

- [Create an Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/).
- [Create a dataset in Axiom](/docs/reference/datasets) where you send your data.
- [Create an API token in Axiom](/docs/reference/tokens) with permissions to create, read, update, and delete datasets.
- Create an AWS account with permissions to create and manage IoT rules, Lambda functions, and IAM roles.

## Create AWS Lambda function

Create a Lambda function with Python runtime and the following content. For more information, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html#getting-started-create-function). The Lambda function acts as an intermediary to process data from AWS IoT and send it to Axiom.

```python
import os  # Import the os module to access environment variables
import json  # Import the json module to handle JSON data
import requests  # Import the requests module to make HTTP requests

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Retrieve the dataset name from the environment variable
    dataset_name = os.environ['DATASET_NAME']
    
    # Construct the Axiom API URL using the dataset name
    axiom_api_url = f"https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/{dataset_name}/ingest"
    
    # Retrieve the Axiom API token from the environment variable
    api_token = os.environ['API_TOKEN']
    
    # Define the headers for the HTTP request to Axiom
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}",  # Set the Authorization header with the token
        "Content-Type": "application/json",  # Specify the content type as JSON
        "X-Axiom-Dataset": dataset_name  # Include the dataset name in the headers
    }
    
    # Create the payload for the HTTP request
    payload = {
        "tags": {"source": "aws-iot"},  # Add a tag to indicate the source of the data
        "events": [{"timestamp": event['timestamp'], "attributes": event}]  # Include the event data
    }
    
    # Send a POST request to the Axiom API with the headers and payload
    response = requests.post(axiom_api_url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    
    # Return the status code and a confirmation message
    return {
        'statusCode': response.status_code,  # Return the HTTP status code from the Axiom API response
        'body': json.dumps('Log sent to Axiom!')  # Return a confirmation message as JSON
    }
```

In the environment variables section of the Lambda function configuration, add the following environment variables:
- `DATASET_NAME` is the name of the Axiom dataset where you want to send data.
- `API_TOKEN` is the Axiom API token you have generated. For added security, store the API token in an environment variable.

<Note>
This example uses Python for the Lambda function. To use another language, change the code above accordingly.
</Note>

## Create AWS IoT rule

Create an IoT rule with an SQL statement similar to the example below that matches the MQTT messages. For more information, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-create-rule.html).

```sql 
SELECT * FROM 'iot/topic'
```

In **Rule actions**, select the action to send a message to a Lambda function, and then choose the Lambda function you created earlier.

## Check logs in Axiom

Use the AWS IoT Console, AWS CLI, or an MQTT client to publish messages to the topic that matches your rule. For example, `iot/topic`.

In Axiom, go to the Datasets tab and select the dataset you specified in the Lambda function. You now see your logs from your IoT devices in Axiom.
