# Send data from Convex to Axiom

This guide explains how to send data from [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) to Axiom.

Convex lets you manage the backend of your application (database, server, and more) from a centralized cloud interface. Set up a log stream in Convex to send your application’s logs to Axiom and make it your single source of truth about events.

## Prerequisites

- [Create an Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/).
- [Create a dataset in Axiom](/docs/reference/settings#data) where you will send your data.
- [Create an API token in Axiom with permissions to query and ingest data](/docs/reference/settings#access-overview).
- [Create a Convex account](https://www.convex.dev/login).
- Set up your application with Convex. For example, follow one of the quickstart guides in the [Convex documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstarts).

## Configure Convex log streams

To send data from Convex to Axiom, set up a Convex log stream using the [Convex documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/production/integrations/log-streams#axiom). During this process, you need the following:

- The name of the Axiom dataset where you want to send data.
- The Axiom API token you have generated.
- Optional: A list of key-value pairs to include in all events your application sends to Axiom.
