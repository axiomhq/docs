Filters out a dataset to a branch of rows that meets a **condition** when executed.

## Syntax

```kusto
| where condition
```

## Arguments

| **name**                  |        **type**                       | **description**                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Condition** | `boolean` | A bool expression over the fields of the dataset, it is then checked for each row in your dataset |

## Returns

Rows in **dataset** for which **condition** is true.

## Examples

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where method == 'GET' and content_type == 'image/jpeg'
```

## Using * has in APL’s where Operator

The * has pattern in APL is a dynamic and powerful tool within the where operator. It offers users the flexibility to search for specific substrings across all fields in a dataset without the need to specify each field name individually. This becomes especially advantageous when dealing with datasets that have numerous or dynamically named fields.

## Basic where * has Usage

Find events where any fields contains a specific substring.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs'] 
| where * has "GET"
```

    target="_blank" 
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
/>

## Combining Multiple Substrings:

Find events where any field contains one of multiple substrings.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs'] 
| where * has "GET" or * has "text"
```

<RunInPlayGround 
    href="https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%5Cn%7C%20where%20%2A%20has%20%5C%22GET%5C%22%20or%20%2A%20has%20%5C%22text%5C%22%22%7D&queryOptions=%7B%22quickRange%22%3A%2230d%22%7D" 
    target="_blank" 
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
/>

## Using * has with other operators

Suppose you want to find events where any field contains a substring, and another specific field equals a certain value.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs'] 
| where * has "css" and req_duration_ms == 1
```

<RunInPlayGround 
    href="https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%5Cn%7C%20where%20%2A%20has%20%5C%22css%5C%22%20and%20req_duration_ms%20%3D%3D%201%22%7D&queryOptions=%7B%22quickRange%22%3A%2230d%22%7D" 
    target="_blank" 
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
/>

## Advanced Chaining

Filter data based on several conditions, including fields containing certain substrings, then summarize by another specific criterion.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where * has "GET" and * has "css"
| summarize Count=count() by method, content_type, server_datacenter
```

    target="_blank" 
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
/>

## Using with Aggregates

Find the average of a specific field for events where any field contains a certain substring.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where * has "japan"
| summarize avg(req_duration_ms)
```

<RunInPlayGround 
    href="https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%5Cn%7C%20where%20%2A%20has%20%5C%22japan%5C%22%5Cn%7C%20summarize%20avg%28req_duration_ms%29%22%7D&queryOptions=%7B%22quickRange%22%3A%2230d%22%7D" 
    target="_blank" 
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
/>

## String Case Transformation

If you’re unsure about the case of the substring in the dataset, convert everything to lowercase for comparison.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where * has "japan"
| summarize avg(req_duration_ms)
```
