Selects specified fields from the input to exclude from the output.

## Syntax

```kusto
| project-away FieldName1, FieldName2, ...
```

The order of the fields in the result is determined by their original order in the dataset. Only the fields that are specified as `arguments` are dropped. The other fields are included in the result. See [project](/docs/apl/tabular-operators/project-operator) for more detail.

## Arguments

| **name**  | **type** | **description**                                         |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Field Name | **string** | The name of the field to be removed from the output. |

## Returns

A table with fields that are not named as arguments. Contains the same number of rows as the input table.

## Examples

```kusto
['http-logs']
| project-away ['geo.city'], ['geo.country'], method
```

## Wildcard

Wildcard refers to a special character or a set of characters that can be used to substitute for any other character(s) in a search pattern. The use of wildcards in Axiom allows you to create more flexible queries and perform more powerful searches.

- In Axiom, the syntax for wildcard can either be `data*` or `['data.fo']*`

Here’s how you can use wildcards in `project-away` 

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| project-away status*, user*, is*,  ['geo.']*
```
