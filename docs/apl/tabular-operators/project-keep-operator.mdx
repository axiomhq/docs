# project-keep operator

Selects specified fields from the input to keep in the output.

The order of the fields in the result is determined by their original order in the dataset. Only the fields that are specified as arguments are kept. The other fields are excluded from the result. See [project](/docs/apl/tabular-operators/project-operator) for more detail.

## Syntax

```apl copy
| project-keep FieldName1, FieldName2, ...
```

## Arguments

| **name**  | **type** | **description**                                    |
| --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Field Name | **string** | The name of the field to be kept in the output. |

## Returns

A table with fields that are named as arguments. Contains the same number of rows as the input table.

## Examples

```apl copy
['http-logs']
| project-keep  ['geo.city'], ['geo.country'], method
```

## Wildcard

Wildcard refers to a special character or a set of characters that can be used to substitute for any other character(s) in a search pattern. The use of wildcards in Axiom allows you to create more flexible queries and perform more powerful searches.

- In Axiom, the syntax for wildcard can either be `data*` or `['data.fo']*`

Here's how you can use wildcards in `project-keep` 

```apl copy
['sample-http-logs']
| project-keep resp*, content*,  ['geo.']*
```
