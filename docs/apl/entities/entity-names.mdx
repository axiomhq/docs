APl entities (datasets, tables, columns, and operators) are named.

For example, two fields or columns in the same dataset can have the same name if the **casing** is different and a table and a dataset may have the same name because they are not in the same scope.

## Columns

- Column names are case-sensitive for resolving purposes and they have a specific position in the dataset’s collection of columns.
- Column names are unique within a dataset and table.
- In queries, columns are generally references by name only. They can only appear in expressions, and the query operator under which the expression appears determines the table or tabular data stream.

## Identifier naming rules

Identifiers are used to name various entities (entities or otherwise). Valid identifier names follow these rules:

- They have between 1 and 1024 characters long.
- They may contain letters, digits, underscores (`_`), spaces, dots (`.`), and dashes (`-`)
- Identifiers consisting only of letters, digits, and underscores do not require quoting when the identifier is being referenced.
- Identifiers containing at least one of (spaces, dots, or dashes) do require quoting.
- They are case-sensitive.

## Identifier quoting

Identifiers that are identical to some query language keywords, or have one of the special characters noted above, require quoting when they are referenced directly by a query:

| **Query Text**                                    | **Comments**                                                                                     |
