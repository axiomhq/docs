Axiom limits the number of calls a user (and their organization) can make over a certain period
of time to ensure fair usage and to maintain the quality of our service for everyone.
Our systems closely monitor API usage and if a user exceeds any thresholds, we will
temporarily halt further processing of requests from that user (and/or organization).
This is to prevent any single user or app from overloading the system,
which could potentially impact other users' experience.

## Rate Limits

Rate limits vary and are specified by the following header in all responses:

| Header                  | Description                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-RateLimit-Scope`     | Indicates if the limits counts against the organisation or personal rate limit.                                         |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests a user is permitted to make per minute.                                                     |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.                                                      |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC [epoch seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). |

**Possible values for X-RateLimit-Scope :**

- `user`
- `organization`

**When the rate limit is exceeded, an error is returned with the status "429 Too Many Requests"**:

```json
{
    "message": "rate limit exceeded",
}
```

## Query Limits

| Header                   | Description                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-QueryLimit-Limit`     | The query cost limit of your plan in Gigabyte Milliseconds (GB*ms).                                                     |
| `X-QueryLimit-Remaining` | The remaining query Gigabyte Milliseconds.                                                                              |
| `X-QueryLimit-Reset`     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC [epoch seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). |

## Ingest Limits

| Header                    | Description                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-IngestLimit-Limit`     | The maximum bytes ingested a user is permitted to make per month.                                                       |
| `X-IngestLimit-Remaining` | The bytes ingested remaining in the current rate limit window.                                                          |
| `X-IngestLimit-Reset`     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC [epoch seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). |

Alongside data volume limits, we also monitor the rate of ingest requests.
If an organization consistently sends an excessive number of requests per second,
far exceeding normal usage patterns, we reserve the right to suspend their ingest
to maintain system stability and ensure fair resource allocation for all users.
To prevent exceeding these rate limits, it is highly recommended to use batching clients,
which can efficiently manage the number of requests by aggregating data before sending.
