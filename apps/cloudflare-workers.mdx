The Axiom Cloudflare Workers app provides granular detail about the traffic coming in from your monitored sites. This includes edge requests, static resources, client auth, response duration, and status. Axiom gives you an all-at-once view of key Cloudflare Workers metrics and logs, out of the box, with our dynamic Cloudflare Workers dashboard.

The data obtained with the Axiom dashboard gives you better insights into the state of your Cloudflare Workers so you can easily monitor bad requests, popular URLs, cumulative execution time, successful requests, and more. The app is part of Axiomâ€™s unified logging and observability platform, so you can easily track Cloudflare Workers edge requests alongside a comprehensive view of other resources in your Cloudflare Worker environments.

<Note>
Axiom Cloudflare Workers is an open-source project and welcomes your contributions. For more information, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-cloudflare-workers).

## What is Cloudflare Workers

[Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) is a serverless computing platform developed by Cloudflare. The Workers platform allows developers to deploy and run JavaScript code directly at the network edge in more than 200 data centers worldwide. This serverless architecture enables high performance, low latency, and efficient scaling for web apps and APIs.

<Prerequisites />

## Send Cloudflare Worker logs to Axiom

1. In Cloudflare, create a new worker. For more information, see the [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/).
1. Copy the contents of the [src/worker.js](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-cloudflare-workers/blob/main/src/worker.js) file into the worker you have created.
1. Update the authentication variables:

    ```bash
    const axiomDataset = "DATASET_NAME"
    const axiomToken = "API_TOKEN"
    ```

    <Replacement />

1. Add triggers for the worker. For example, add a route trigger using the [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/routes/#set-up-a-route-in-the-dashboard).

When the routes receive requests, the worker is triggered and the logs are sent to your Axiom dataset.
