Use the Axiom Lambda Extension to enrich your Axiom organization with quick filters and a dashboard.

For information on how to send logs and platform events of your Lambda function to Axiom, see [Send data from AWS Lambda](/send-data/aws-lambda).

## What's the Axiom Lambda Extension

AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code at scale without provisioning or maintaining servers.

Use the AWS Lambda Extension to collect Lambda logs, performance metrics, platform events, and memory usage from your Lambda functions. With the Axiom Lambda Extension, you can monitor Lambda performance, aggregate system-level metrics for your serverless applications, and optimize Lambda functions through easy-to-use automatic dashboards.

With the Axiom Lambda Extension, you can:

- Monitor your Lambda functions and invocations
- Get full visibility into your AWS Lambda events in minutes
- Collect metrics and logs from your Lambda-based serverless applications
- Track and view enhanced memory usage by versions, durations, and cold starts
- Detect and get alerts on Lambda event errors, request timeouts, and low execution times

## Comprehensive AWS Lambda dashboards

The Axiom AWS Lambda integration includes a pre-built dashboard where you can see and group your functions with their versions and AWS resource triggers. This dashboard is the ideal starting point for getting an advanced view of your AWS Lambda serverless services' performance and health. The AWS Lambda dashboards automatically appear in Axiom through schema detection after you install the Axiom Lambda Extension.

These zero-config dashboards help you spot and troubleshoot Lambda function errors. For example, if there's high memory usage on your functions, you can identify unusual delays from the max execution dashboard and filter errors by functions, durations, invocations, and versions. Using your Lambda version name, you can expand your view of Lambda event source mapping and invocation types.

## Monitor Lambda functions and usage in Axiom

Real-time visibility into your function logs is crucial because any delay between sending your Lambda request and execution time can increase customer-facing latency. You need to measure and track your Lambda invocations, execution time ranges, and all invocations by function.

The Axiom Lambda Extension provides full visibility into the most important metrics and logs from your Lambda function out of the box without additional configuration.

## Track cold starts on your Lambda function

A cold start occurs when there's a delay between invocation and runtime during the initialization process. During this period, no function instance is available to respond to an invocation. With the Axiom built-in serverless AWS Lambda dashboard, you can track cold starts' effects on your Lambda functions and their impact on each function. This data helps you determine when to take actionable steps, such as using provisioned concurrency or reducing function dependencies.

## Optimize slow-performing Lambda queries

Grouping logs with Lambda invocations and execution times by function provides insights into your event request and response patterns. You can extend your query to view when an invocation request is rejected and configure alerts for serverless log patterns and Lambda function payloads. With the invocation request dashboard, you can monitor request function logs and see how your Lambda serverless functions process events and queues over time.

## Detect timeouts on your Lambda function

Axiom Lambda function monitors help you identify invocation failures, cold-start delays, and AWS Lambda errors. By monitoring standard function logs like invocations by function and Lambda cold starts, you can track execution time rates and receive alerts about significant spikes when errors occur.

## Smart filters

Axiom Lambda Serverless Smart Filters let you easily filter specific AWS Lambda functions or serverless projects and use saved queries to get deep insights into function performance with a single click.
