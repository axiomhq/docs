[AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) is a networking service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to securely access services hosted on the AWS cloud over a private network connection. With AWS PrivateLink, you can access Axiom directly from your AWS without an internet gateway or NAT device, simplifying your network setup.

## Cross-region support

Axiom supports native cross-region PrivateLink over VPC peering for the following regions:

US regions:
- `us-east-1`
- `us-east-2`
- `us-west-1`
- `us-west-2`

EU regions:
- `eu-west-1`
- `eu-west-2`
- `eu-west-3`
- `eu-central-1`

To connect to a region that isn’t listed above, [contact Axiom](https://axiom.co/contact).

## Setup

1. In your VPC Console, go to **PrivateLink and Lattice > Endpoints**, and then click **Create endpoint**.
1. Select **PrivateLink ready partner services**, and then enter the service name for your target region from the table below.

    | Region | Service name |
    | --- | --- |
    | us-east-1 | com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-05a64735cdf68866b |
    TODO

1. Under **Service Region**, turn on **Cross-region endpoint**, and then click **Verify service**.
1. Select the VPC and subnets that you want to connect to the Axiom VPC service endpoint. Ensure that **Enable DNS name** is turned on and the security group accepts inbound traffic on TCP port `443`.
1. Finish the setup and wait for the VPC endpoint to become available. This usually takes 10 minutes.
