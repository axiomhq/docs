Cloudflare Logpush is a feature that allows you to push HTTP request logs and other Cloudflare-generated logs directly to your desired storage, analytics, and monitoring solutions like Axiom. The integration with Axiom provides real-time insights into web traffic and operational issues, helping you monitor and troubleshoot effectively.

## What's Cloudflare Logpush?

Cloudflare Logpush enables Cloudflare users to automatically export their logs in JSON format to a variety of endpoints. This feature is useful for analytics, auditing, debugging, and monitoring the performance and security of websites. Types of logs you can export include HTTP request logs, firewall events, and more.

## Installing Cloudflare Logpush app

### Prerequisites

- An active Cloudflare Enterprise account
- API token or global API key

</Frame>

You can create a token that has access to a single zone, single account, or a mix of all these, depending on your needs. For account access, the token must
have these permissions:
  - Logs: Edit
  - Account settings: Read

For the zones, only edit permission is required for logs.

## Steps

1. Log in to Cloudflare, go to your Cloudflare dashboard, and then select the Enterprise zone (domain) you want to enable Logpush for.

2. Optionally, set filters and fields. You can filter logs by field (like Client IP, User Agent) and set the type of logs you want (for example, HTTP requests, firewall events).

3. In Axiom, click **Settings**, select **Apps**, and install the Cloudflare Logpush app with the token you created from the profile settings in Cloudflare.

5. The installation uses the Cloudflare API to create Logpush jobs for each selected dataset.

6. After the installation completes, you can find the installed Logpush jobs in Cloudflare.

7. In Axiom, you can see your Cloudflare Logpush dashboard.

Using Axiom with Cloudflare Logpush offers a powerful solution for real-time monitoring, observability, and analytics. Axiom helps you gain deep insights into your app's performance, errors, and bottlenecks.

### Benefits of using the Axiom Cloudflare Logpush Dashboard

- Real-time visibility into web performance: See how your website or app performs in real time. The dashboard shows everything from page load times to error rates, giving you immediate insights for timely decision-making.

- Actionable insights for troubleshooting: The dashboard provides more than raw dataâ€”it offers insights. Whether it's an error that needs immediate fixing or performance metrics that show an error from your app, having this information readily available makes it easier to identify and resolve problems.

- DNS metrics: Track DNS requests, queries, and cache hits from your app to monitor request spikes or get the total number of queries in your system.

- Centralized logging and error tracing: With logs from various parts of your app stack, centralizing them within Axiom makes it easier to correlate events across different infrastructure layers. This is crucial for troubleshooting complex issues that span multiple services or components.
