## What’s Convex?

[Convex](https://convex.dev) is the backend platform that keeps your app in sync. It’s the open source, reactive database where queries are TypeScript code running right in the database. Just like React components react to state changes, Convex queries react to database changes.

Convex provides a database, a place to write your server functions, and client libraries. It makes it easy to build and scale dynamic live-updating apps.

## What are Convex log streams?

Log streams enable streaming of events such as function executions and console.logs from your Convex deployment to supported destinations like Axiom, Datadog, or custom webhooks.

<Info>
Log streams require a Convex Professional plan. Learn more about [Convex pricing plans](https://www.convex.dev/pricing) or upgrade your account.
</Info>

The most recent logs produced by your Convex deployment can be viewed in the Dashboard Logs page, the Convex CLI, or in the browser console. However, log streaming to Axiom enables:

- **Historical log storage** beyond the recent logs view
- **Powerful querying** with Axiom Processing Language (APL)
- **Advanced data visualization** and custom dashboards
- **Integration with monitoring tools** like PagerDuty, Slack, and more
- **Real-time alerting** based on function performance and errors

## Prerequisites

- [Create an Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/)
- [Create a dataset in Axiom](/reference/datasets) where you want to send your Convex logs
- [Create an API token in Axiom](/reference/tokens) with permissions to create, read, update, and delete datasets
- [Create a Convex account](https://www.convex.dev/login) with a Professional plan
- Set up your app with Convex following one of the [quickstart guides](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstarts)

## Configure Convex log streams

To send data from Convex to Axiom, set up a Convex log stream using the [Convex documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/production/integrations/log-streams#axiom).

<Steps>
<Step title="Access log streams settings">
  In your Convex dashboard, navigate to Settings and then the Log Streams tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Axiom integration">
  Click "Configure" next to Axiom and provide the following information:
  
  - **Dataset name**: The name of your Axiom dataset
  - **API key**: Your Axiom API token
  - **Attributes** (optional): Key-value pairs to include in all log events sent to Axiom
  
  <Tip>
  Attributes are useful for adding context like project name, environment, or team information to all your logs.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify connection">
  Once configured, Convex will verify the connection to Axiom. You’ll see a confirmation when the log stream is active.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Automatic dashboard creation

When you configure a Convex dataset in Axiom, a dashboard is automatically created in the Integrations section of the Dashboards tab. This pre-built dashboard provides immediate insights into your Convex function performance and errors.

<Check>
You can find the automatic dashboard in Axiom under Dashboards > Integrations. To customize the layout, you can fork the dashboard and modify it to your needs.

## Monitor function performance

With Convex log streams in Axiom, you can monitor and analyze your function performance in real-time. The automatic dashboard provides immediate insights, and you can create custom queries using the structured log data.

### Track function execution times

Identify slow-performing functions by analyzing execution times:

```apl
['convex']
| where data.topic == "function_execution"
| summarize 
    avg(data.execution_time_ms) as avg_time_ms,
    max(data.execution_time_ms) as max_time_ms,
    count() as total_calls
  by data.function.path
| order by avg_time_ms desc
```

### Monitor function errors

Track functions that are experiencing failures:

```apl
['convex']
| where data.topic == "function_execution" and data.status == "failure"
| summarize count() by data.function.path, data.function.type
| order by count() desc
```

### Analyze function types

Compare performance across different function types (queries, mutations, actions):

```apl
['convex']
| where data.topic == "function_execution"
| summarize 
    count() as total_calls,
    avg(data.execution_time_ms) as avg_duration_ms
  by data.function.type
```

### Track database usage

Monitor database read patterns and identify resource-intensive functions:

```apl
['convex']
| where data.topic == "function_execution"
| summarize 
    avg(data.usage.database_read_documents) as avg_docs_read,
    avg(data.usage.database_read_bytes) as avg_bytes_read
  by data.function.path
| order by avg_bytes_read desc
```

### Monitor cache performance

Track query cache hit rates for optimization:

```apl
['convex']
| where data.topic == "function_execution" 
  and data.function.type == "query"
  and isnotempty(data.function.cached)
| summarize 
    countif(data.function.cached == true) as cache_hits,
    count() as total_queries
| extend cache_hit_rate = (cache_hits * 100) / total_queries
```

### Track scheduled job performance

Monitor scheduled job lag and performance:

```apl
['convex']
| where data.topic == "scheduled_job_lag"
| summarize 
    max(data.lag_seconds) as max_lag_seconds,
    avg(data.lag_seconds) as avg_lag_seconds
  by convex.project_slug, convex.deployment_name
```

## Set up monitoring and alerting

Create monitors to get notified about issues in your Convex deployment:

### Function failure rate alerts

Monitor functions with high error rates:

```apl
['convex']
| where data.topic == "function_execution"
| summarize 
    count() as total_calls,
    countif(data.status == "failure") as failures
  by data.function.path
| extend error_rate = (failures * 100) / total_calls
| where error_rate > 5  // Alert if error rate exceeds 5%
```

### Slow function alerts

Set up alerts for functions exceeding execution time thresholds:

```apl
['convex']
| where data.topic == "function_execution" and data.execution_time_ms > 5000
| summarize count() by data.function.path
```

## Log data structure

Convex log streams send structured data to Axiom with the following key fields:

- **`data.topic`**: Event type ("function_execution", "scheduled_job_lag")
- **`data.status`**: Execution status ("success", "failure")
- **`data.function.path`**: Full function path
- **`data.function.type`**: Function type ("query", "mutation", "action")
- **`data.function.component_path`**: Component path
- **`data.execution_time_ms`**: Function execution time in milliseconds
- **`data.usage.database_read_documents`**: Number of documents read
- **`data.usage.database_read_bytes`**: Bytes of data read
- **`data.function.cached`**: Cache hit indicator for queries
- **`convex.project_slug`**: Convex project identifier
- **`convex.deployment_name`**: Deployment name
- **`convex.deployment_type`**: Deployment type

## Benefits of Convex log streaming

The Convex log streaming integration with Axiom provides several key benefits:

1. **Complete observability**: Monitor all function executions, errors, and performance metrics in one place
2. **Historical analysis**: Store and analyze logs beyond Convex's recent logs view
3. **Advanced querying**: Use APL to create complex queries and aggregations
4. **Real-time monitoring**: Set up alerts and monitors for proactive issue detection
5. **Custom dashboards**: Build tailored visualizations for your specific use cases
6. **Team collaboration**: Share insights and dashboards with your development team
