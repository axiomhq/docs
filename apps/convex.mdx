## Convex and log streams

[Convex](https://convex.dev) is the backend platform that keeps your app in sync. It’s the open source, reactive database where queries are TypeScript code running right in the database. Just like React components react to state changes, Convex queries react to database changes.

Convex provides a database, a place to write your server functions, and client libraries. It makes it easy to build and scale dynamic live-updating apps.

Log streams enable streaming of events such as function executions and `console.log`s from your Convex deployment to supported destinations like Axiom, Datadog, or custom webhooks.

<Info>
Log streams require a Convex Professional plan. Learn more about [Convex pricing plans](https://www.convex.dev/pricing) or upgrade your account.

## Benefits of connecting Axiom with Convex

Convex’s built-in features allow you to see the most recent logs produced by your deployment. Additionally, log streaming to Axiom provides comprehensive observability for your backend operations.

- **Historical log storage** beyond the recent logs view.
- **Powerful querying** with Axiom Processing Language (APL).
- **Advanced data visualization** and custom dashboards.
- **Integration with monitoring tools** like PagerDuty, Slack, and more.
- **Real-time alerting** based on function performance and errors.

## Analyze function performance

After sending Convex log streams to Axiom, explore your Convex data and analyze your function performance using Axiom’s powerful [query capabilities](/query-data/explore).

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Track function execution times">
Identify slow-performing functions by analyzing execution times:

```kusto
['convex']
| where data.topic == "function_execution"
| summarize 
    avg(data.execution_time_ms) as avg_time_ms,
    max(data.execution_time_ms) as max_time_ms,
    count() as total_calls
  by data.function.path
| order by avg_time_ms desc
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Track function errors">
Track functions that are experiencing failures:

```kusto
['convex']
| where data.topic == "function_execution" and data.status == "failure"
| summarize count() by data.function.path, data.function.type
| order by count() desc
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Analyze function types">
Compare performance across different function types (queries, mutations, actions):

```kusto
['convex']
| where data.topic == "function_execution"
| summarize 
    count() as total_calls,
    avg(data.execution_time_ms) as avg_duration_ms
  by data.function.type
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Track database usage">
Track database read patterns and identify resource-intensive functions:

```kusto
['convex']
| where data.topic == "function_execution"
| summarize 
    avg(data.usage.database_read_documents) as avg_docs_read,
    avg(data.usage.database_read_bytes) as avg_bytes_read
  by data.function.path
| order by avg_bytes_read desc
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Track cache performance">
Track query cache hit rates for optimization:

```kusto
['convex']
| where data.topic == "function_execution" 
  and data.function.type == "query"
  and isnotempty(data.function.cached)
| summarize 
    countif(data.function.cached == true) as cache_hits,
    count() as total_queries
| extend cache_hit_rate = (cache_hits * 100) / total_queries
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Track scheduled job performance">
Track scheduled job lag and performance:

```kusto
['convex']
| where data.topic == "scheduled_job_lag"
| summarize 
    max(data.lag_seconds) as max_lag_seconds,
    avg(data.lag_seconds) as avg_lag_seconds
  by convex.project_slug, convex.deployment_name
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Set up monitoring and alerting

[Create monitors](/monitor-data/monitors) to get notified about issues in your Convex deployment.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Function failure rate alerts">
Monitor functions with high error rates:

```kusto
['convex']
| where data.topic == "function_execution"
| summarize 
    count() as total_calls,
    countif(data.status == "failure") as failures
  by data.function.path
| extend error_rate = (failures * 100) / total_calls
| where error_rate > 5  // Alert if error rate exceeds 5%
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Slow function alerts">

Set up alerts for functions exceeding execution time thresholds:

```kusto
['convex']
| where data.topic == "function_execution" and data.execution_time_ms > 5000
| summarize count() by data.function.path
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Prebuilt dashboard

When you configure a Convex dataset in Axiom, a dashboard is automatically created in the **Integrations** section of the Dashboards tab. This prebuilt dashboard provides immediate insights into your Convex function performance and errors.

The dashboard includes:

- **Function execution metrics**: Success rates, error counts, and performance trends.
- **Database operation insights**: Query patterns, mutation frequencies, and subscription activity.
- **Error analysis**: Error types, frequency, and affected functions.
- **Performance monitoring**: Response times, throughput, and resource utilization.

You can customize this dashboard or create additional dashboards tailored to your specific monitoring needs and business requirements. For more information, see [Create dashboards](/dashboards/create) and [Configure dashboards](/dashboards/configure).

## Log data structure

Convex log streams send structured data to Axiom with the following key fields:

- **`data.topic`**: Event type
- **`data.status`**: Execution status
- **`data.function.path`**: Full function path
- **`data.function.type`**: Function type
- **`data.function.component_path`**: Component path
- **`data.execution_time_ms`**: Function execution time in milliseconds
- **`data.usage.database_read_documents`**: Number of documents read
- **`data.usage.database_read_bytes`**: Bytes of data read
- **`data.function.cached`**: Cache hit indicator for queries
- **`convex.project_slug`**: Convex project identifier
- **`convex.deployment_name`**: Deployment name
- **`convex.deployment_type`**: Deployment type
