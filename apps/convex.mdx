## Convex and log streams

[Convex](https://convex.dev) is the backend platform that keeps your app in sync. It’s the open source, reactive database where queries are TypeScript code running right in the database. Just like React components react to state changes, Convex queries react to database changes.

Convex provides a database, a place to write your server functions, and client libraries. It makes it easy to build and scale dynamic live-updating apps.

Log streams enable streaming of events such as function executions and `console.log`s from your Convex deployment to supported destinations like Axiom, Datadog, or custom webhooks.

<Info>
Log streams require a Convex Professional plan. Learn more about [Convex pricing plans](https://www.convex.dev/pricing) or upgrade your account.

## Benefits of connecting Axiom with Convex

Convex’s built-in features allow you to see the most recent logs produced by your deployment. Additionally, log streaming to Axiom provides comprehensive observability for your backend operations.

- **Historical log storage** beyond the recent logs view.
- **Powerful querying** with Axiom Processing Language (APL).
- **Advanced data visualization** and custom dashboards.
- **Integration with monitoring tools** like PagerDuty, Slack, and more.
- **Real-time alerting** based on function performance and errors.

## Analyze function performance

After sending Convex log streams to Axiom, explore your Convex data and analyze your function performance using Axiom’s powerful [query capabilities](/query-data/explore). For example, you can:

- **Track function execution times**: Identify slow-performing functions by analyzing execution times.
- **Monitor function errors**: Track functions that are experiencing failures.
- **Analyze function types**: Compare performance across different function types (queries, mutations, actions).
- **Track database usage**: Monitor database read patterns and identify resource-intensive functions.
- **Monitor cache performance**: Track query cache hit rates for optimization.
- **Track scheduled job performance**: Monitor scheduled job lag and performance.

## Set up monitoring and alerting

[Create monitors](/monitor-data/monitors) to get notified about issues in your Convex deployment. For example, you can set up a monitor to alert youa about the following:

- **Function failure rate alerts**: Monitor functions with high error rates.
- **Slow function alerts**: Set up alerts for functions exceeding execution time thresholds.
- **Database operation alerts**: Set up alerts for database operations exceeding thresholds.
- **Cache performance alerts**: Set up alerts for cache performance exceeding thresholds.
- **Scheduled job performance alerts**: Set up alerts for scheduled job performance exceeding thresholds.

## Prebuilt dashboard

When you configure a Convex dataset in Axiom, a dashboard is automatically created in the **Integrations** section of the Dashboards tab. This prebuilt dashboard provides immediate insights into your Convex function performance and errors.

The dashboard includes:

- **Function execution metrics**: Success rates, error counts, and performance trends.
- **Database operation insights**: Query patterns, mutation frequencies, and subscription activity.
- **Error analysis**: Error types, frequency, and affected functions.
- **Performance monitoring**: Response times, throughput, and resource utilization.

You can customize this dashboard or create additional dashboards tailored to your specific monitoring needs and business requirements. For more information, see [Create dashboards](/dashboards/create) and [Configure dashboards](/dashboards/configure).

## Next steps
