import Prerequisites from "/snippets/standard-prerequisites.mdx"

Netlify is a platform for building and deploying highly performant websites, e-commerce stores, and web apps. Netlify automatically builds your site and deploys it across its global edge network.

Integrating Axiom with Netlify allows you to stream traffic, function, and deployment logs directly to Axiom, giving you comprehensive observability over your Netlify projects. With real-time, unsampled data, you can monitor site performance, detect errors quickly, and make informed decisions about your Jamstack apps.

The Netlify integration supports all [edge deployments](/reference/edge-deployments). The integration sends data to your organization's default edge deployment automatically.

<Note>
This integration is only available for Netlify customers on enterprise-level plans where Log Drains are supported. For more information, see [Netlify documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/manage/monitoring/log-drains/).
</Note>

## Netlify dashboard

Axiom displays the data it receives in a pre-built Netlify dashboard that delivers immediate, actionable insights into your sites' activity and performance.

This comprehensive overview includes:

- **Traffic logs**: Monitor traffic volume, request patterns, and site configurations.
- **Function logs**: Track serverless function executions, errors, and resource usage.
- **Live log streaming**: Stream your site and app logs live with filtering for important information.

With these insights, you can:

- Quickly detect site errors and unusual traffic patterns.
- Monitor serverless function performance and resource usage.
- Analyze your build and deployment processes.
- Drill down into specific events using APL queries.
- Fork the dashboard and build your own custom site monitors.
