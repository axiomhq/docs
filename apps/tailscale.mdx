Tailscale is a game-changer in the world of secure networking. Tailscale allows you to easily create and manage a private network—called a tailnet—using the WireGuard protocol. With Tailscale, you can securely connect your devices, no matter where they are in the world.

That’s why we’re excited to announce our integration with Tailscale, a leader in secure networking solutions. This partnership allows Tailscale customers to stream their audit and network flow logs directly to Axiom seamlessly, unlocking powerful insights and analysis. Whether you’re conducting a security audit, optimizing performance, or ensuring compliance, Axiom’s Tailnet dashboard equips you with the tools to maintain a secure and efficient network, respond quickly to potential issues and make informed decisions about your network configuration and usage.

## Setup

1. In Tailscale, go to the [configuration logs page](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/logs) of the admin console.
2. Add Axiom as a configuration log streaming destination in Tailscale. For more information, see the [Tailscale documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1255/log-streaming?q=stream#add-a-configuration-log-streaming-destination).

Once data flows, Axiom will automatically provide your pre-built Tailscale dashboard.
Within minutes you’ll have access to comprehensive insights about your tailnet, allowing you to set up custom alerts, perform detailed analyses, and route events as needed.

The Axiom Tailscale dashboard provided with integration delivers immediate, actionable insights into your tailnet's activity and health. This comprehensive overview includes:

Log type distribution: Understand the balance between configuration audit logs and network flow logs over time.
Top actions and hosts: Identify the most common network actions and most active devices.
Traffic visualization: View physical, virtual, and exit traffic patterns for both sources and destinations.
User activity tracking: Monitor actions by user display name, email, and ID for security audits and compliance.
Configuration log stream: Access a detailed audit trail of all configuration changes.
With these insights, you can:

Quickly identify unusual network activity or traffic patterns.
Track configuration changes and user actions.
Monitor overall network health and performance.
Investigate specific events or users as needed.
Understand traffic distribution across your tailnet.
