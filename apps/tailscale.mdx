Tailscale is a secure networking solution that allows you to create and manage a private network (tailnet), securely connecting all your devices.

Integrating Axiom with Tailscale allows you to stream your audit and network flow logs directly to Axiom seamlessly, unlocking powerful insights and analysis. Whether you’re conducting a security audit, optimizing performance, or ensuring compliance, Axiom’s Tailscale dashboard equips you with the tools to maintain a secure and efficient network, respond quickly to potential issues, and make informed decisions about your network configuration and usage.
