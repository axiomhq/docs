Tailscale is a secure networking solution that allows you to create and manage a private network (tailnet), securely connecting all your devices.

Integrating Axiom with Tailscale allows you to stream your audit and network flow logs directly to Axiom seamlessly, unlocking powerful insights and analysis. Whether you’re conducting a security audit, optimizing performance, or ensuring compliance, Axiom’s Tailscale dashboard equips you with the tools to maintain a secure and efficient network, respond quickly to potential issues, and make informed decisions about your network configuration and usage.

## Tailscale dashboard

Axiom displays the data it receives in a pre-built Tailscale dashboard that delivers immediate, actionable insights into your tailnet’s activity and health.

This comprehensive overview includes:

- **Log type distribution**: Understand the balance between configuration audit logs and network flow logs over time.
- **Top actions and hosts**: Identify the most common network actions and most active devices.
- **Traffic visualization**: View physical, virtual, and exit traffic patterns for both sources and destinations.
- **User activity tracking**: Monitor actions by user display name, email, and ID for security audits and compliance.
- **Configuration log stream**: Access a detailed audit trail of all configuration changes.

With these insights, you can:

- Quickly identify unusual network activity or traffic patterns.
- Track configuration changes and user actions.
- Monitor overall network health and performance.
- Investigate specific events or users as needed.
- Understand traffic distribution across your tailnet.
