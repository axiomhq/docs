Tailscale is a secure networking solution that allows you to create and manage a private network (tailnet), securely connecting all your devices.

Integrating Axiom with Tailscale allows you to stream your audit and network flow logs directly to Axiom seamlessly, unlocking powerful insights and analysis. Whether you’re conducting a security audit, optimizing performance, or ensuring compliance, Axiom’s Tailscale dashboard equips you with the tools to maintain a secure and efficient network, respond quickly to potential issues, and make informed decisions about your network configuration and usage.

<Prerequisites />
- [Create a Tailscale account](https://login.tailscale.com/start).

## Setup

1. In Tailscale, go to the [configuration logs page](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/logs) of the admin console.
2. Add Axiom as a configuration log streaming destination in Tailscale. For more information, see the [Tailscale documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1255/log-streaming?q=stream#add-a-configuration-log-streaming-destination).
3. Once the configuration is complete, Tailscale begins streaming logs to the dataset you specified in Axiom.

<Note>
When Axiom receives the first batch of Tailscale logs, a pre-built Tailscale dashboard is automatically created in your organization. This usually happens within a few minutes of completing the setup.
</Note>

## Access the Tailscale dashboard

After the integration sends data to Axiom, access your pre-built Tailscale dashboard:

1. In Axiom, click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/dashboard.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Dashboard icon" /> **Dashboards** in the left navigation.
2. Find the dashboard named **Tailscale** in your dashboard list.
3. Click the dashboard to view your tailnet insights.

<Tip>
If you don't see the Tailscale dashboard in your dashboard list, ensure that Tailscale is successfully sending data to Axiom. Go to the **Stream** tab of your Tailscale dataset to verify that events are being ingested. The dashboard is automatically created after the first events arrive.
</Tip>

You can also query your Tailscale data directly by:
- Going to the **Query** tab
- Selecting your Tailscale dataset
- Writing APL queries to analyze your logs

### Customize the dashboard

The pre-built dashboard provides a great starting point, but you can customize it for your specific needs:

1. Click **Fork** in the top right of the dashboard to create your own copy
2. Add new charts, modify existing ones, or adjust time ranges
3. Save your customized dashboard with a new name

This allows you to preserve the original dashboard while building custom views for your organization's specific monitoring requirements.

## Tailscale dashboard overview

Axiom displays the data it receives in a pre-built Tailscale dashboard that delivers immediate, actionable insights into your tailnet’s activity and health.

This comprehensive overview includes:

- **Log type distribution**: Understand the balance between configuration audit logs and network flow logs over time.
- **Top actions and hosts**: Identify the most common network actions and most active devices.
- **Traffic visualization**: View physical, virtual, and exit traffic patterns for both sources and destinations.
- **User activity tracking**: Monitor actions by user display name, email, and ID for security audits and compliance.
- **Configuration log stream**: Access a detailed audit trail of all configuration changes.

With these insights, you can:

- Quickly identify unusual network activity or traffic patterns.
- Track configuration changes and user actions.
- Monitor overall network health and performance.
- Investigate specific events or users as needed.
- Understand traffic distribution across your tailnet.
