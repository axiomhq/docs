The `count` operator in Axiom Processing Language (APL) is a simple yet powerful aggregation function that returns the total number of records in a dataset. You can use it to calculate the number of rows in a table or the results of a query. The `count` operator is useful in scenarios such as log analysis, telemetry data processing, and security monitoring, where you need to know how many events, transactions, or data entries match certain criteria.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk’s SPL, the `stats count` function is used to count the number of events in a dataset. In APL, the equivalent operation is simply `count`. You can use `count` in APL without the need for additional function wrapping.

<CodeGroup>
```splunk Splunk example
index=web_logs
| stats count
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| count
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, you typically use `COUNT(*)` or `COUNT(field)` to count the number of rows in a table. In APL, the `count` operator achieves the same functionality, but it doesn’t require a field name or `*`.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM web_logs;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| count
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
| count
```

### Parameters

The `count` operator does not take any parameters. It simply returns the number of records in the dataset or query result.

### Returns

`count` returns an integer representing the total number of records in the dataset.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In this example, you count the total number of HTTP requests in the `['sample-http-logs']` dataset.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| count
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20count%22%7D)

**Output**

| count |
|-------|
| 15000 |

This query returns the total number of HTTP requests recorded in the logs.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

In this example, you count the number of traces in the `['otel-demo-traces']` dataset.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces'] |
count
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20count%22%7D)

**Output**

| count |
|-------|
| 5000 |

This query returns the total number of OpenTelemetry traces in the dataset.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In this example, you count the number of security events in the `['sample-http-logs']` dataset where the status code indicates an error (status codes 4xx or 5xx).

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs'] |
where status startswith '4' or status startswith '5' |
count
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20where%20status%20startswith%20'4'%20or%20status%20startswith%20'5'%20%7C%20count%22%7D)

**Output**

| count |
|-------|
| 1200 |

This query returns the number of HTTP requests that resulted in an error (HTTP status code 4xx or 5xx).

## List of related operators

- [summarize](/apl/tabular-operators/summarize-operator): The `summarize` operator is used to aggregate data based on one or more fields, allowing you to calculate sums, averages, and other statistics, including counts. Use `summarize` when you need to group data before counting.
- [extend](/apl/tabular-operators/extend-operator): The `extend` operator adds calculated fields to a dataset. You can use `extend` alongside `count` if you want to add additional calculated data to your query results.
- [project](/apl/tabular-operators/project-operator): The `project` operator selects specific fields from a dataset. While `count` returns the total number of records, `project` can limit or change which fields you see.
- [where](/apl/tabular-operators/where-operator): The `where` operator filters rows based on a condition. Use `where` with `count` to only count records that meet certain criteria.
- [take](/apl/tabular-operators/take-operator): The `take` operator returns a specified number of records. You can use `take` to limit results before applying `count` if you're interested in counting a sample of records.
