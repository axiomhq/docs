---

The `extend-valid` operator in Axiom Processing Language (APL) allows you to extend a set of fields with new calculated values, where these calculations are based on conditions of validity for each row. Itâ€™s particularly useful when working with datasets that contain missing or invalid data, as it enables you to calculate and assign values only when certain conditions are met. This operator helps you keep your data clean by applying calculations to valid data points, and leaving invalid or missing values untouched.

This is a shorthand operator to create a field while also doing basic checking on the validity of the field. In many cases, additional checks are required and it is recommended in those cases a combination of an [extend](/apl/tabular-operators/extend-operator) and a [where](/apl/tabular-operators/where-operator) operator are used. The basic checks that Axiom preform depend on the type of the expression:

- **Dictionary:** Check if the dictionary is not null and has at least one entry.
- **Array:** Check if the arrat is not null and has at least one value.
- **String:** Check is the string is not empty and has at least one character.
- **Other types:** The same logic as `tobool` and a check for true.

You can use `extend-valid` to perform conditional transformations on large datasets, especially in scenarios where data quality varies or when dealing with complex log or telemetry data.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, similar functionality is achieved using the `eval` function, but with the `if` command to handle conditional logic for valid or invalid data. In APL, `extend-valid` is more specialized for handling valid data points directly, allowing you to extend fields based on conditions.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| eval new_field = if(isnotnull(field), field + 1, null())
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs'] 
| extend-valid new_field = req_duration_ms + 100
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, similar functionality is often achieved using the `CASE WHEN` expression within a `SELECT` statement to handle conditional logic for fields. In APL, `extend-valid` directly extends a field conditionally, based on the validity of the data.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT CASE WHEN req_duration_ms IS NOT NULL THEN req_duration_ms + 100 ELSE NULL END AS new_field FROM sample_http_logs;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs'] 
| extend-valid new_field = req_duration_ms + 100
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
| extend-valid FieldName1 = Expression1, FieldName2 = Expression2, FieldName3 = ...
```

### Parameters

- `FieldName`: The name of the existing field that you want to extend.
- `Expression`: The expression to evaluate and apply for valid rows.

### Returns

The operator returns a table where the specified fields are extended with new values based on the given expression for valid rows. The original value remains unchanged.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In this use case, you normalize the HTTP request methods by converting them to uppercase for valid entries.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend-valid upper_method = toupper(method)
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20extend-valid%20upper_method%20%3D%20toupper(method)%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | method | upper_method |
|---------------------|--------|--------------|
| 2023-10-01 12:00:00 | get    | GET          |
| 2023-10-01 12:01:00 | POST   | POST         |
| 2023-10-01 12:02:00 | NULL   | NULL         |

In this query, the `toupper` function converts the `method` field to uppercase, but only for valid entries. If the `method` field is null, the result remains null.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

In this use case, you extract the first part of the service namespace (before the hyphen) from valid namespaces in the OpenTelemetry traces.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| extend-valid namespace_prefix = extract('^(.*?)-', 1, ['service.namespace'])
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20extend-valid%20namespace_prefix%20%3D%20extract('%5E(.*%3F)-'%2C%201%2C%20%5B'service.namespace'%5D)%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | service.namespace                | namespace_prefix |
|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 2023-10-01 12:00:00 | opentelemetry-demo     | opentelemetry       |
| 2023-10-01 12:01:00 | opentelemetry-prod     | opentelemetry       |
| 2023-10-01 12:02:00 | NULL                    | NULL         |

In this query, the `extract` function pulls the first part of the service namespace. It only applies to valid `service.namespace` values, leaving nulls unchanged.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In this use case, you extract the first letter of the city names from the `geo.city` field for valid log entries.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend-valid city_first_letter = extract('^([A-Za-z])', 1, ['geo.city'])
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20extend-valid%20city_first_letter%20%3D%20extract('%5E(%5BA-Za-z%5D)'%2C%201%2C%20%5B'geo.city'%5D)%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | geo.city | city_first_letter |
|---------------------|--------------|-----------|
| 2023-10-01 12:00:00 | New York     | N       |
| 2023-10-01 12:01:00 | NULL         | NULL      |
| 2023-10-01 12:02:00 | London       | L    |
| 2023-10-01 12:03:00 | 1Paris       | NULL    |

In this query, the `extract` function retrieves the first letter of the city names from the `geo.city` field for valid entries. If the `geo.city` field is null or starts with a non-alphabetical character, no city name is extracted, and the result remains null.

- [extend](/apl/tabular-operators/extend-operator): Use `extend` to add calculated fields unconditionally, without validating data.
- [project](/apl/tabular-operators/project-operator): Use `project` to select and rename fields, without performing conditional extensions.
- [summarize](/apl/tabular-operators/summarize-operator): Use `summarize` for aggregation, often used before extending fields with further calculations.
