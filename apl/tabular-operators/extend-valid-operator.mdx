Creates calculated columns that are used to filter out rows. If valid it then appends them to the
result set.

This is a shorthand operator to create a field while also doing basic checking on the validity
of the field. In many cases, additional checks are required and it is recommended in those cases
a combination of an [extend](/apl/tabular-operators/extend-operator) and a [where](/apl/tabular-operators/where-operator) operator are used. The
basic checks that are preformed are dependent on the type of the expression. Checks are as follows:

 * [Dictionaries](../data-types/scalar-data-types#the-dynamic-data-type). The valid is checked to ensure it is not [null](../data-types/null-values) and has at least one entry in
   the dictionary.
 * [Arrays](../data-types/scalar-data-types#the-dynamic-data-type). Arrays should not be [null](../data-types/null-values) and should have at least one value.
 * [Strings](../data-types/scalar-data-types#the-string-data-type). Strings should not be empty and have at least one character in them.
 * [Other types](/apl/data-types/scalar-data-types). The same logic as tobool and a check for true

Some situations you'd want to not use **extend-valid** for including checking to see if a map has a
particular key in it. Cases where an empty array is valid. Where returning and empty string could
be a useful result. Or when a value of a number being 0 should be included in the new field.

### Syntax

```kusto
| extend-valid alias1 = expression1, alias2 = expression2, alias3 = ...
```

### Arguments

| **name**                | **type**       | **description**                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Alias                   | **string**     | The name of the column to add or update.       |
| Expression              | **expression** | A calculation over the columns of the dataset. |

### Returns

Rows in **dataset** for which **Expression** is valid with:

- Column names noted by extend that already exist in the input are removed and appended as their new calculated values.
- Column names noted by extend that do not exist in the input are appended as their new calculated values.

### Examples

```kusto
['http-logs']
// if content_type is "" this will filter the row
| extend-valid upper_ct = toupper(content_type)
```
