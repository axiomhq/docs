## What is the search operator in APL

The search operator in APL is a special operator that scans full-text search over the specified datasets. Instead of specifying a particular field or condition, the search operator allows for a broad search across multiple fields for a given text or phrase.

## Importance of the search operator:

- Versatility: It allows users to find a specific text or term across various fields within a dataset that they choose or select for their search, without the necessity to specify each field.

- Efficiency: Saves time when you aren’t sure which field or datasets in APL might contain the information you are looking for.

- User-Friendliness: It’s particularly useful for users or developers unfamiliar with the schema details of a given database.

## Search operator syntax

```kusto
search [kind=<Search Kind>] <Search-Expression>
```

or

```kusto
search [kind= CaseSensitivity ] SearchPredicate
```

## Parameters

| Name           |             Type |                   Required |         Description |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Dataset** | string        |             &check;            | The data to be searched over in a dataset.|
| **CaseSensitivity** or **Search Kind**               | string |                  | A flag that controls the behavior of all `string` scalar operators, such as `has`, with respect to case sensitivity. Valid values are `default`, `case_insensitive`, `case_sensitive`. The options `default` and `case_insensitive` are synonymous, since the default behavior is case insensitive.|
| **SearchPredicate** or **SearchExpression** | string |  &check; | A boolean expression to be evaluated for every event in the input. If it returns `true`, the record is outputted.|

## Search predicate syntax 

The SearchPredicate allows you to search for specific terms in all fields of a dataset. The operator that will be applied to a search term depends on the presence and placement of a wildcard asterisk (*) in the term, as shown in the following table.

|Literal   |Operator   |
|----------|-----------|
|`axiomk`   |`has`      |
|`*axiomk`  |`hassuffix`|
|`axiomk*`  |`hasprefix`|
|`*axiomk*` |`contains` |
|`ax*ig`   |`matches regex`|

You can also restrict the search to a specific field, look for an exact match instead of a term match, or search by regular expression. The syntax for each of these cases is shown in the following table.

|Syntax|Explanation|
|--|--|
|**FieldName**`:`**StringLiteral** | This syntax can be used to restrict the search to a specific field. The default behavior is to search all fields. |
|**FieldName**`==`**StringLiteral** | This syntax can be used to search for exact matches of a field against a string value. The default behavior is to look for a term-match.|
| **Field** `matches regex` **StringLiteral** | This syntax indicates regular expression matching, in which *StringLiteral* is the regex pattern.|

Use boolean expressions to combine conditions and create more complex searches. For example, `"axiom" and b==789` would result in a search for events that have the term axiom in any field and the value 789 in the b field.

## Using kind=case_insensitive

Explicitly search for logs that contain the term "CSS" without case sensitivity.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| search kind=case_insensitive "CSS"
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%5Cn%7C%20search%20kind%3Dcase_insensitive%20%5C%22CSS%5C%22%22%7D&queryOptions=%7B%22quickRange%22%3A%2230d%22%7D)

## Using search *

Search all logs. This would essentially return all rows in the dataset.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| search *
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%5Cn%7C%20search%20%2A%22%7D&queryOptions=%7B%22quickRange%22%3A%2230d%22%7D)

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| search "GET" or "covina"
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%5Cn%7C%20search%20%5C%22GET%5C%22%20or%20%5C%22covina%5C%22%22%7D&queryOptions=%7B%22quickRange%22%3A%2230d%22%7D)

## Use the `search` operator efficiently

Using non-field-specific filters such as the `search` operator has an impact on performance, especially when used over a high volume of events in a wide time range. To use the `search` operator efficiently, follow these guidelines:

- Use field-specific filters when possible. Field-specific filters narrow your query results to events where a field has a given value. They are more efficient than non-field-specific filters, such as the `search` operator, that narrow your query results by searching across all fields for a given value. When you know the target field, replace the `search` operator with `where` clauses that filter for values in a specific field.
- After using the `search` operator in your query, use other operators, such as `project` statements, to limit the number of returned fields.
- Use the `kind` flag when possible. When you know the pattern that string values in your data follow, use the `kind` flag to specify the case-sensitivity of the search.
