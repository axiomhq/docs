---

The `distinct` operator in APL (Axiom Processing Language) returns a unique set of values from a specified column or set of columns. This operator is useful when you need to filter out duplicate entries and focus only on distinct values, such as unique user IDs, event types, or error codes within your datasets. Use the `distinct` operator in scenarios where eliminating duplicates helps you gain clearer insights from your data, like when analyzing logs, monitoring system traces, or reviewing security incidents.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunkâ€™s SPL, the `dedup` command is often used to retrieve distinct values. In APL, the equivalent is the `distinct` operator, which behaves similarly by returning unique values but without necessarily ordering them.

<CodeGroup>
```splunk Splunk example
index=web_logs
| dedup user_id
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs'] 
| distinct id
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, you use `SELECT DISTINCT` to return unique rows from a table. In APL, the `distinct` operator serves a similar function but is placed after the table reference rather than in the `SELECT` clause.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM web_logs;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs'] 
| distinct id
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
| distinct ColumnName1 [, ColumnName2, ...]
```

### Parameters

- **ColumnName1, ColumnName2, ...**: The columns to include in the distinct operation. If you specify multiple columns, the result will include rows where the combination of values across these columns is unique.

### Returns

The `distinct` operator returns a dataset with unique values from the specified columns, removing any duplicate entries.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In this use case, the `distinct` operator helps identify unique users who made HTTP requests in a system.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| distinct id
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20distinct%20id%22%7D)

**Output**

| id         |
|------------|
| user_123   |
| user_456   |
| user_789   |

This query returns a list of unique user IDs that have made HTTP requests, filtering out duplicate user activity.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

Here, the `distinct` operator is used to identify all unique services involved in traces.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| distinct ['service.name']
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20distinct%20%5B'service.name'%5D%22%7D)

**Output**

| service.name          |
|-----------------------|
| frontend              |
| checkoutservice       |
| productcatalogservice |

This query returns a distinct list of services involved in traces.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In this example, you use the `distinct` operator to find unique HTTP status codes from security logs.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| distinct status
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20distinct%20status%22%7D)

**Output**

| status   |
|----------|
| 200      |
| 404      |
| 500      |

This query provides a distinct list of HTTP status codes that occurred in the logs.

## List of related operators

- [**`count`**](/apl/tabular-operators/count-operator): Returns the total number of rows. Use it to count occurrences of data rather than filtering for distinct values.
- [**`summarize`**](/apl/tabular-operators/summarize-operator): Allows you to aggregate data and perform calculations like sums or averages while grouping by distinct values.
- [**`project`**](/apl/tabular-operators/project-operator): Selects specific columns from the dataset. Use it when you want to control which columns are returned before applying `distinct`.
