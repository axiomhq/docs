---

The `where` operator in APL filters rows based on specified conditions. Use the `where` operator to return only the records that meet your defined criteria. It's a foundational operator for querying datasets, helping you focus on specific data by filtering out unwanted rows. This is useful when you work with large datasets, logs, traces, or security events to extract meaningful information quickly.

## For users of other query languages

If you use other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, the `where` operator filters events based on boolean expressions. APL's `where` operator functions similarly, allowing you to filter rows that satisfy a condition.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
index=main | where status="200"
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| where status == '200'
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, the `WHERE` clause filters rows in a `SELECT` query based on a condition. APL's `where` operator behaves similarly, but the syntax reflects APL's specific dataset structures.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT * FROM sample_http_logs WHERE status = '200'
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| where status == '200'
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
| where condition
```

### Parameters

- `condition`: A Boolean expression that specifies the filtering condition. The `where` operator returns only the rows that satisfy this condition.

### Returns

The `where` operator returns a filtered dataset containing only the rows where the condition evaluates to true.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In this example, you filter HTTP logs to focus on records where the HTTP status is 404 (Not Found).

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where status == '404'
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20where%20status%20%3D%3D%20'404'%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time              | id   | status | method | uri           | req_duration_ms | geo.city  | geo.country |
|--------------------|------|--------|--------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2024-10-17 10:20:00| 12345| 404    | GET    | /notfound.html| 120             | Seattle   | US          |

This query filters out all HTTP requests except those that resulted in a 404 error, making it easy to investigate missing pages.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

Here, you filter OpenTelemetry traces to get spans where the `duration` exceeded 500 milliseconds.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| where duration > 500ms
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20where%20duration%20%3E%20500ms%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time              | span_id  | trace_id | duration | service.name      | kind    | status_code |
|--------------------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-10-17 11:15:00| abc123   | xyz789   | 520ms    | frontend           | server  | OK          |

This query helps identify spans with durations longer than 500 milliseconds, which might indicate performance issues.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In this security example, you filter logs to find requests from users in Germany.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where ['geo.country'] == 'Germany'
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20where%20%5B'geo.country'%5D%20%3D%3D%20'Germany'%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time              | id   | status | method | uri           | req_duration_ms | geo.city  | geo.country |
|--------------------|------|--------|--------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2024-10-17 09:45:00| 54321| 200    | POST   | /login        | 100             | Berlin    | Germany     |

This query filters logs to investigate activity from a specific country, which is useful for security and compliance.

## where * has

The `* has` pattern in APL is a dynamic tool within the `where` operator. It lets you search for specific substrings across all fields in a dataset without specifying each field name. This is especially useful when dealing with datasets that have many or dynamically named fields.

`where * has` is an expensive operation because it searches all fields. For a more efficient query, explicitly list the fields you want to search. For example: `where firstName has "miguel" or lastName has "miguel"`. 

### Basic where * has usage

Find events where any field contains a specific substring.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs'] 
| where * has "GET"
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%5Cn%7C%20where%20%2A%20has%20%5C%22GET%5C%22%22%7D&queryOptions=%7B%22quickRange%22%3A%2230d%22%7D)

### Combine multiple substrings

Find events where any field contains one of multiple substrings.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs'] 
| where * has "GET" or * has "text"
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%5Cn%7C%20where%20%2A%20has%20%5C%22GET%5C%22%20or%20%2A%20has%20%5C%22text%5C%22%22%7D&queryOptions=%7B%22quickRange%22%3A%2230d%22%7D)

### Use * has with other operators

Find events where any field contains a substring and another specific field equals a value.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs'] 
| where * has "css" and req_duration_ms == 1
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%5Cn%7C%20where%20%2A%20has%20%5C%22css%5C%22%20and%20req_duration_ms%20%3D%3D%201%22%7D&queryOptions=%7B%22quickRange%22%3A%2230d%22%7D)

### Advanced chaining

Filter data based on several conditions, including fields containing certain substrings, then summarize by another criterion.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where * has "GET" and * has "css"
| summarize Count=count() by method, content_type, server_datacenter
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%5Cn%7C%20where%20%2A%20has%20%5C%22GET%5C%22%20and%20%2A%20has%20%5C%22css%5C%22%5Cn%7C%20summarize%20Count%3Dcount%28%29%20by%20method%2C%20content_type%2C%20server_datacenter%22%7D&queryOptions=%7B%22quickRange%22%3A%2230d%22%7D)

### Use with aggregations

Find the average of a specific field for events where any field contains a certain substring.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where * has "Japan"
| summarize avg(req_duration_ms)
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%5Cn%7C%20where%20%2A%20has%20%5C%22Japan%5C%22%5Cn%7C%20summarize%20avg%28req_duration_ms%29%22%7D&queryOptions=%7B%22quickRange%22%3A%2230d%22%7D)

### String case transformation

The `has` operator is case-insensitive. Use `has` if you're unsure about the case of the substring in the dataset. For case-sensitive matching, use `has_cs`.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where * has "mexico"
| summarize avg(req_duration_ms)
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%5Cn%7C%20where%20%2A%20has%20%5C%22mexico%5C%22%5Cn%7C%20summarize%20avg%28req_duration_ms%29%22%7D&queryOptions=%7B%22quickRange%22%3A%2230d%22%7D)
