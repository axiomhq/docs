---

The `project-keep` operator in APL is a powerful tool for field selection. It allows you to explicitly keep specific fields from a dataset, discarding any others not listed in the operator's parameters. This is useful when you only need to work with a subset of fields in your query results and want to reduce clutter or improve performance by eliminating unnecessary fields.

You can use `project-keep` when you need to focus on particular data points, such as in log analysis, security event monitoring, or extracting key fields from traces.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, the `table` command performs a similar task to APL’s `project-keep`. It selects only the fields you specify and excludes any others.

<CodeGroup>
```splunk Splunk example
index=main | table _time, status, uri
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs'] 
| project-keep _time, status, uri
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, the `SELECT` statement combined with field names performs a task similar to `project-keep` in APL. Both allow you to specify which fields to retrieve from the dataset.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT _time, status, uri FROM sample_http_logs
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs'] 
| project-keep _time, status, uri
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
| project-keep FieldName1, FieldName2, ...
```

### Parameters

- `FieldName`: The field you want to keep in the result set.

### Returns

`project-keep` returns a dataset with only the specified fields. All other fields are removed from the output. The result contains the same number of rows as the input table.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

For log analysis, you might want to keep only the fields that are relevant to investigating HTTP requests.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs'] 
| project-keep _time, status, uri, method, req_duration_ms
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%20%7C%20project-keep%20_time%2C%20status%2C%20uri%2C%20method%2C%20req_duration_ms%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | status | uri                 | method | req_duration_ms |
|---------------------|--------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|
| 2024-10-17 10:00:00 | 200    | /index.html         | GET    | 120             |
| 2024-10-17 10:01:00 | 404    | /non-existent.html   | GET    | 50              |
| 2024-10-17 10:02:00 | 500    | /server-error        | POST   | 300             |

This query filters the dataset to show only the request timestamp, status, URI, method, and duration, which can help you analyze server performance or errors.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

For OpenTelemetry trace analysis, you may want to focus on key tracing details such as service names and trace IDs.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces'] 
| project-keep _time, trace_id, span_id, ['service.name'], duration
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27otel-demo-traces%27%5D%20%7C%20project-keep%20_time%2C%20trace_id%2C%20span_id%2C%20%5B%27service.name%27%5D%2C%20duration%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | trace_id     | span_id     | service.name   | duration |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| 2024-10-17 10:03:00 | abc123       | xyz789      | frontend       | 500ms    |
| 2024-10-17 10:04:00 | def456       | mno345      | checkoutservice| 250ms    |

This query extracts specific tracing information, such as trace and span IDs, the name of the service, and the span’s duration.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In security log analysis, focusing on essential fields like user ID and HTTP status can help track suspicious activity.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs'] 
| project-keep _time, id, status, uri, ['geo.city'], ['geo.country']
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%20%7C%20project-keep%20_time%2C%20id%2C%20status%2C%20uri%2C%20%5B%27geo.city%27%5D%2C%20%5B%27geo.country%27%5D%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | id        | status | uri           | geo.city    | geo.country |
|---------------------|-----------|--------|---------------|-------------|-------------|

This query narrows down the data to track HTTP status codes by users, helping identify potential unauthorized access attempts.

## List of related operators

- [project](/apl/tabular-operators/project-operator): Use `project` to explicitly specify the fields you want in your result, while also allowing transformations or calculations on those fields.
- [extend](/apl/tabular-operators/extend-operator): Use `extend` to add new fields or modify existing ones without dropping any fields.
- [summarize](/apl/tabular-operators/summarize-operator): Use `summarize` when you need to perform aggregation operations on your dataset, grouping data as necessary.

## Wildcard

Wildcard refers to a special character or a set of characters that can be used to substitute for any other character in a search pattern. Use wildcards to create more flexible queries and perform more powerful searches.

The syntax for wildcard can either be `data*` or `['data.fo']*`.

Here’s how you can use wildcards in `project-keep`:

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| project-keep resp*, content*,  ['geo.']*
```
