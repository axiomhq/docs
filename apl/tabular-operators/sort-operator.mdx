## Introduction

The `sort` operator in APL arranges the rows of a result set based on one or more columns in ascending or descending order. You can use it to organize your data logically or optimize subsequent operations that depend on ordered data. This operator is useful when analyzing logs, traces, or any dataset where the order of results matters, such as when you’re interested in top or bottom performers, chronological sequences, or sorting by status codes.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, the equivalent of `sort` is the `sort` command, which orders search results based on one or more fields. However, in APL, you must explicitly specify the sorting direction for each column, and sorting by multiple columns requires chaining them with commas.

<CodeGroup>
```splunk Splunk example
| sort - _time, status
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| sort by _time desc, status asc
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In SQL, sorting is done using the `ORDER BY` clause. The APL `sort` operator behaves similarly but uses the `by` keyword instead of `ORDER BY`. Additionally, APL requires specifying the order direction (`asc` or `desc`) explicitly for each column.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT * FROM sample_http_logs
ORDER BY _time DESC, status ASC
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| sort by _time desc, status asc
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
| sort by column1 [asc | desc], column2 [asc | desc], ...
```

### Parameters

- `column1`, `column2`, ...: The columns to sort by.
- [asc | desc]: Specify the sorting direction for each column as either `asc` for ascending order or `desc` for descending order.

### Returns

A table with rows ordered based on the specified columns.

## Use sort and project together

When you use `project` and `sort` in the same query, ensure you project the fields that you want to sort on. Similarly, when you use `project-away` and `sort` in the same query, ensure you don’t remove the fields that you want to sort on.

The above is also true for time fields. For example, to project the field `status` and sort on the field `_time`, project both fields similarly to the query below:

```apl
['sample-http-logs']
| project status, _time
| sort by _time desc
```

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

Sorting HTTP logs by request duration and then by status code is useful to identify slow requests and their corresponding statuses.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| sort by req_duration_ms desc, status asc
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%20%7C%20sort%20by%20req_duration_ms%20desc%2C%20status%20asc%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | req_duration_ms | id   | status | uri             | method | geo.city | geo.country |
|---------------------|-----------------|------|--------|-----------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-10-18 12:34:56 | 5000            | abc1 | 500    | /api/data       | GET    | New York | US          |
| 2024-10-18 12:35:56 | 4500            | abc2 | 200    | /api/users      | POST   | London   | UK          |

The query sorts the HTTP logs by the duration of each request in descending order, showing the longest-running requests at the top. If two requests have the same duration, they are sorted by status code in ascending order.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

Sorting OpenTelemetry traces by span duration helps identify the longest-running spans within a specific service.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| sort by duration desc, ['service.name'] asc
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27otel-demo-traces%27%5D%20%7C%20sort%20by%20duration%20desc%2C%20%5B%27service.name%27%5D%20asc%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | duration | span_id | trace_id | service.name       | kind    | status_code |
|---------------------|----------|---------|----------|--------------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-10-18 12:36:56 | 00:00:15 | span1   | trace1   | frontend           | server  | 200         |
| 2024-10-18 12:37:56 | 00:00:14 | span2   | trace2   | cartservice        | client  | 500         |

This query sorts spans by their duration in descending order, with the longest spans at the top, followed by the service name in ascending order.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

Sorting security logs by status code and then by timestamp can help in investigating recent failed requests.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| sort by status asc, _time desc
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%20%7C%20sort%20by%20status%20asc%2C%20_time%20desc%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | req_duration_ms | id   | status | uri             | method | geo.city | geo.country |
|---------------------|-----------------|------|--------|-----------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-10-18 12:40:56 | 3000            | abc3 | 400    | /api/login      | POST   | Toronto  | CA          |
| 2024-10-18 12:39:56 | 2000            | abc4 | 400    | /api/auth       | GET    | Berlin   | DE          |

This query sorts security logs by status code first (in ascending order) and then by the most recent events.

## List of related operators

- [**`top`**](/apl/tabular-operators/top-operator): Use `top` to return a specified number of rows with the highest or lowest values, but unlike `sort`, `top` limits the result set.
- [**`project`**](/apl/tabular-operators/project-operator): Use `project` to select and reorder columns without changing the order of rows.
- [**`extend`**](/apl/tabular-operators/extend-operator): Use `extend` to create calculated columns that can then be used in conjunction with `sort` to refine your results.
- [**`summarize`**](/apl/tabular-operators/summarize-operator): Use `summarize` to group and aggregate data before applying `sort` for detailed analysis.
