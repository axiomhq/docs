Sorts the rows of the dataset into an order by one or more columns.

## Syntax

```kusto
| sort by Expression [asc | desc] [, ...]
```

## Arguments

| **name**   | **type**     | **description**                                                                               |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| expression | **expression** | A scalar expression by which to sort. The value type must be numeric, date, time or string. |
| asc        | **string**     | Sort by into ascending order, low to high.                                                    |
| desc       | **string**     | Sort by into descending order, high to low.                                                   |

## Use sort and project together

When you use `project` and `sort` in the same query, ensure you project the fields that you want to sort on. Similarly, when you use `project-away` and `sort` in the same query, ensure you donâ€™t remove the fields that you want to sort on.

The above is also true for time fields. For example, to project the field `status` and sort on the field `_time`, project both fields similarly to the query below:

```apl
['sample-http-logs']
| project status, _time
| sort by _time desc
```

## Examples

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where method == 'GET'
| sort by method
```
