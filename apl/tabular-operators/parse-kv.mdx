---

The `parse-kv` operator parses key-value pairs from a string field into individual columns. You use it when your data is stored in a single string that contains structured information, such as `key=value` pairs. With `parse-kv`, you can extract the values into separate columns to make them easier to query, filter, and analyze.

This operator is useful in scenarios where logs, traces, or security events contain metadata encoded as key-value pairs. Instead of manually splitting strings, you can use `parse-kv` to transform the data into a structured format.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk, you often use the `kv` or `extract` commands to parse key-value pairs from raw log data. In APL, you achieve similar functionality with the `parse-kv` operator. The difference is that `parse-kv` explicitly lets you define which keys to extract and what delimiters to use.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
... | kv pairdelim=";" kvdelim="=" keys="key1,key2,key3"
````

```kusto APL equivalent
datatable(data:string)
[
  'key1=a;key2=b;key3=c'
]
| parse-kv data as (key1, key2, key3) with (pair_delimiter=';', kv_delimiter='=')
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

ANSI SQL does not have a direct equivalent of `parse-kv`. Typically, you would use string functions such as `SUBSTRING` or `SPLIT_PART` to manually extract key-value pairs. In APL, `parse-kv` simplifies this process by automatically extracting multiple keys in one step.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT
  SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(data, ';', 1), '=', -1) as key1,
  SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(data, ';', 2), '=', -1) as key2,
  SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(data, ';', 3), '=', -1) as key3
FROM logs;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
datatable(data:string)
[
  'key1=a;key2=b;key3=c'
]
| parse-kv data as (key1, key2, key3) with (pair_delimiter=';', kv_delimiter='=')
```

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
parse-kv Expression as (KeysList) with (pair_delimiter = PairDelimiter, kv_delimiter = KvDelimiter [, Options...])
```

### Parameters

| Parameter        | Description                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Expression`     | The string expression that contains the key-value pairs.                        |
| `KeysList`       | A list of keys to extract into separate columns.                                |
| `PairDelimiter` | A character or string that separates key-value pairs (for example, `;` or `,`). |
| `KvDelimiter`   | A character or string that separates keys and values (for example, `=` or `:`). |
| `Options`        | Additional parsing options, such as case sensitivity.                           |

### Returns

A dataset where each specified key is extracted into its own column with the corresponding value. If a key is missing in the original string, the column is empty for that row.

## Use case example

When analyzing HTTP logs, you might encounter a field where request metadata is encoded as key-value pairs. You can extract values like status and duration for easier analysis.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| parse-kv kvdata as (status, req_duration_ms) with (pair_delimiter=';', kv_delimiter='=')
| project _time, status, req_duration_ms, method, uri
```

**Output**

| _time               | status | req_duration_ms | method | uri      |
| -------------------- | ------ | ----------------- | ------ | -------- |
| 2024-05-01T10:00:00Z | 200    | 120               | GET    | /home    |
| 2024-05-01T10:01:00Z | 404    | 35                | GET    | /missing |

This query extracts status and request duration from a concatenated field and projects them alongside other useful fields.

- [extend](/apl/tabular-operators/extend-operator): Adds calculated columns. Use when parsing is not required but you want to create new derived columns.
- [parse](/apl/tabular-operators/parse-operator): Extracts values from a string expression without filtering out non-matching rows. Use when you want to keep all rows, including those that fail to parse.
- [project](/apl/tabular-operators/project-operator): Selects and computes columns without parsing. Use when you want to transform data rather than extract values.
- [where](/apl/tabular-operators/where-operator): Filters rows based on conditions. Use alongside parsing functions if you want more control over filtering logic.
