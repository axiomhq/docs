---

Combines events from two or more datasets, returning rows from each of them. This operator processes rows sourced from multiple datasets into a set of results. Based on the set union principle from mathematics, `union` is ideal for merging data from multiple sources for comprehensive data analysis.

## Syntax

```kusto
['DatasetA']
| union ['DatasetB', 'DatasetC', ...]
```

## Arguments

| name | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dataset name | **string** | Name of the dataset to be included in the union. Multiple datasets can be included in the union. |

## Returns

A combined event comprising all rows from the included datasets. If fields overlap, they are merged. Non-overlapping fields are retained in their original form.

## Examples

**Basic union**

Combines all rows from `github-push-event` and `github-pull-request-event` without any transformation or filtering.

```kusto
['github-push-event']
| union ['github-pull-request-event']
```

**Filtering after union**

Combines the datasets, and then filters the data to only include rows where the `method` is `GET`.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| union ['github-issues-event']
| where method == "GET"
```

**Aggregating after union**

Combines the datasets and summarizes the data, counting the occurrences of each combination of `content_type` and `actor`.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| union ['github-pull-request-event']
| summarize Count = count() by content_type, actor
```
