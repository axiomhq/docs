# project operator

The `project` operator in Axiom Processing Language (APL) is used to select specific fields from a dataset, potentially renaming them or applying on-the-fly calculations. With `project`, you can control which fields are returned by the query, allowing you to focus on only the data you need.

This operator is useful when you want to refine your query results by reducing the number of fields, renaming them, or deriving new fields based on existing data. It's a powerful tool for filtering out unnecessary fields and performing light transformations on your dataset.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, the equivalent of the `project` operator is typically the `table` or `fields` command. While SPL's `table` focuses on selecting fields, `fields` controls both selection and exclusion, similar to `project` in APL.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| table _time, status, uri
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| project _time, status, uri
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, the `SELECT` statement serves a similar role to the `project` operator in APL. SQL users will recognize that `project` behaves like selecting fields from a table, with the ability to rename or transform fields inline.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT _time, status, uri FROM sample_http_logs;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| project _time, status, uri
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
| project FieldName [= Expression] [, ...]
```

Or

```kusto
| project FieldName, FieldName, FieldName, ...
```

Or

```kusto
| project [FieldName, FieldName[,] = Expression [, ...]
```

### Parameters

- `FieldName`: The names of the fields in the order you want them to appear in the result set. If there is no Expression, then FieldName is required, and a field of that name must appear in the input.
- `Expression`: Optional scalar expression referencing the input fields.

### Returns

The `project` operator returns a dataset containing only the specified fields.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In this example, you'll extract the timestamp, HTTP status code, and request URI from the sample HTTP logs.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| project _time, status, uri
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20project%20_time%2C%20status%2C%20uri%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | status | uri                |
|---------------------|--------|--------------------|
| 2024-10-17 12:00:00 | 200    | /api/v1/getData     |
| 2024-10-17 12:01:00 | 404    | /api/v1/getUser     |

The query returns only the timestamp, HTTP status code, and request URI, reducing unnecessary fields from the dataset.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

In this example, you'll extract trace information such as the service name, span ID, and duration from OpenTelemetry traces.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| project ['service.name'], span_id, duration
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20project%20%5B'service.name'%5D%2C%20span_id%2C%20duration%22%7D)

**Output**

| service.name         | span_id          | duration |
|----------------------|------------------|----------|
| frontend             | span-1234abcd    | 00:00:02 |
| cartservice          | span-5678efgh    | 00:00:05 |

The query isolates relevant tracing data, such as the service name, span ID, and duration of spans.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In this example, you'll focus on security log entries by projecting only the timestamp, user ID, and HTTP status from the sample HTTP logs.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| project _time, id, status
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20project%20_time%2C%20id%2C%20status%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | id    | status |
|---------------------|-------|--------|
| 2024-10-17 12:00:00 | user1 | 200    |
| 2024-10-17 12:01:00 | user2 | 403    |

The query extracts only the timestamp, user ID, and HTTP status for analysis of access control in security logs.

- [**extend**](/apl/tabular-operators/extend-operator): Use `extend` to add new fields or calculate values without removing any existing fields.
- [**summarize**](/apl/tabular-operators/summarize-operator): Use `summarize` to aggregate data across groups of rows, which is useful when you're calculating totals or averages.
- [**where**](/apl/tabular-operators/where-operator): Use `where` to filter rows based on conditions, often paired with `project` to refine your dataset further.
