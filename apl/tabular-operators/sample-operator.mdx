description: 'This page explains how to use the sample operator function in APL.'
---

The `sample` operator in APL psuedo-randomly selects rows from the input dataset at a rate specified by a parameter. This operator is useful when you want to analyze a subset of data, reduce the dataset size for testing, or quickly explore patterns without processing the entire dataset. The sampling algorithm is not statistically rigorous but provides a way to explore and understand a dataset. For statistically rigorous analysis, use `summarize` instead.

You can find the `sample` operator useful when working with large datasets, where processing the entire dataset is resource-intensive or unnecessary. It’s ideal for scenarios like log analysis, performance monitoring, or sampling for data quality checks.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, the `sample` command works similarly, returning a subset of data rows randomly. However, the APL `sample` operator requires a simpler syntax without additional arguments for biasing the randomness.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| sample 10
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs'] 
| sample 0.1
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, there is no direct equivalent to the `sample` operator, but you can achieve similar results using the `TABLESAMPLE` clause. In APL, `sample` operates independently and is more flexible, as it’s not tied to a table scan.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT * FROM table TABLESAMPLE (10 ROWS);
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs'] 
| sample 0.1
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
| sample ProportionOfRows
```

### Parameters

- `ProportionOfRows`: A float greater than 0 and less than 1 which specifies the proportion of rows to return from the dataset. The rows are selected randomly.

### Returns

The operator returns a table containing the specified number of rows, selected randomly from the input dataset.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In this use case, you sample a small number of rows from your HTTP logs to quickly analyze trends without working through the entire dataset.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| sample 0.05
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%20%7C%20sample%200.05%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | req_duration_ms | id        | status | uri                | method | geo.city | geo.country |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------|--------|--------------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 2023-10-16 12:45:00 | 234             | user1     | 200    | /index             | GET    | New York | US          |
| 2023-10-16 12:47:00 | 120             | user2     | 404    | /login             | POST   | Paris    | FR          |
| 2023-10-16 12:48:00 | 543             | user3     | 500    | /checkout          | POST   | Tokyo    | JP          |

This query returns a random subset of 5 % of all rows from the HTTP logs, helping you quickly identify any potential issues or patterns without analyzing the entire dataset.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

In this use case, you sample traces to investigate performance metrics for a particular service across different spans.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| where ['service.name'] == 'checkoutservice'
| sample 0.05
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27otel-demo-traces%27%5D%20%7C%20where%20%5B%27service.name%27%5D%20%3D%3D%20%27checkoutservice%27%20%7C%20sample%200.05%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | duration   | span_id    | trace_id | service.name     | kind    | status_code |
|---------------------|------------|------------|----------|------------------|---------|-------------|
| 2023-10-16 14:05:00 | 1.34s      | span5678   | trace123 | checkoutservice   | client  | 200         |
| 2023-10-16 14:06:00 | 0.89s      | span3456   | trace456 | checkoutservice   | server  | 500         |

This query returns 5 % of all traces for the `checkoutservice` to identify potential performance bottlenecks.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In this use case, you sample security log data to spot irregular activity in requests, such as 500-level HTTP responses.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where status == '500'
| sample 0.03
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%20%7C%20where%20status%20%3D%3D%20%27500%27%20%7C%20sample%200.03%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | req_duration_ms | id        | status | uri       | method | geo.city | geo.country |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|----------|-------------|

This query helps you quickly spot failed requests (HTTP 500 responses) and investigate any potential causes of these errors.
