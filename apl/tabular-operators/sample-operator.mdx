Psuedo-randomly selects rows at a rate specified by a parameter. The sampling algorithm is not statistically rigorous but provides a way to explore and understand a dataset. For statistically rigorous analysis [summarize](/apl/tabular-operators/summarize-operator) should be used.

## Syntax

```kusto
| sample <rate>
```

## Arguments

| **name**     | **type**  | **description**                                                                                              |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sample Rate  | **float** | A number greater than 0 and less than 1 which specifies how many rows are selected for the next operation.   |

## Example

```kusto
['http-logs']
| sample 0.1 // 10% of the logs go on
```
