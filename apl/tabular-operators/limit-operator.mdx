---

The `limit` operator in Axiom Processing Language (APL) allows you to restrict the number of rows returned from a query. It’s particularly useful when you want to see only a subset of results from large datasets, such as when debugging or previewing query outputs. The `limit` operator can help optimize performance and focus analysis by reducing the amount of data processed.

Use the `limit` operator when you want to return only the top rows from a dataset, especially in cases where the full result set isn’t necessary.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk, the equivalent to APL’s `limit` is the `head` command, which also returns the top rows of a dataset. The main difference is in the syntax.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| head 10
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs'] 
| limit 10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, the `LIMIT` clause is equivalent to the `limit` operator in APL. The SQL `LIMIT` statement is placed at the end of a query, whereas in APL, the `limit` operator comes after the dataset reference.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT * FROM sample_http_logs LIMIT 10;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs'] 
| limit 10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
| limit [N]
```

### Parameters

- `N`: The maximum number of rows to return. This must be a non-negative integer up to 50,000.

<Note>
The maximum value for `N` is 50,000 rows. If you need to export or process more than 50,000 rows, consider using pagination with time-based filtering or the API endpoints with cursor-based pagination.
</Note>

### Returns

The `limit` operator returns the top **`N`** rows from the input dataset. If fewer than **`N`** rows are available, all rows are returned.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In log analysis, you often want to view only the most recent entries, and `limit` can help narrow the focus on those rows.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| limit 5
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20limit%205%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | req_duration_ms | id   | status | uri               | method | geo.city | geo.country |
|---------------------|-----------------|------|--------|-------------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-10-17T12:00:00 | 200             | 123  | 200    | /index.html       | GET    | New York | USA         |
| 2024-10-17T11:59:59 | 300             | 124  | 404    | /notfound.html    | GET    | London   | UK          |

This query limits the output to the first 5 rows from the `['sample-http-logs']` dataset, returning recent HTTP log entries.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

When analyzing OpenTelemetry traces, you may want to focus on the most recent traces.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| limit 5
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20limit%205%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | duration | span_id | trace_id | service.name | kind     | status_code |
|---------------------|----------|---------|----------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-10-17T12:00:00 | 500ms    | 1abc    | 123xyz   | frontend     | server   | OK          |
| 2024-10-17T11:59:59 | 200ms    | 2def    | 124xyz   | cartservice  | client   | OK          |

This query retrieves the first 5 rows from the `['otel-demo-traces']` dataset, helping you analyze the latest traces.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

For security log analysis, you might want to review the most recent login attempts to ensure no anomalies exist.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where status == '401'
| limit 5
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20where%20status%20%3D%3D%20'401'%20%7C%20limit%205%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time               | req_duration_ms | id   | status | uri               | method | geo.city | geo.country |
|---------------------|-----------------|------|--------|-------------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-10-17T12:00:00 | 300             | 567  | 401    | /login.html       | POST   | Berlin   | Germany     |

This query limits the output to 5 unauthorized access attempts (`401` status code) from the `['sample-http-logs']` dataset.
