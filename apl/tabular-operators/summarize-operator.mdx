Produces a table that aggregates the content of the dataset.

## Syntax

```kusto
| summarize [[Column =] Aggregation [, ...]] [by [Column =] GroupExpression [, ...]]
```

## Arguments

| **name**        | **type**       | **description**                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Field           | **string**     | Result Field Name                                                                        |
| Aggregation     | **function**   | A call to an aggregation function such as min() or max(), with Field names as arguments. |
| GroupExpression | **expression** | A scalar expression that can reference the dataset                                       |

## Returns

- The input rows are arranged into groups having the same values of the `by` expressions.
- Then the specified aggregation functions are computed over each group, producing a row for each group.
- The result contains the `by` columns and also at least one column for each computed aggregate. (Some aggregation functions return multiple columns.)

## Examples

```kusto
['http-logs']
| summarize topk(content_type, 20)
```

Returns a table that shows the heatmap in each interval [0, 30], [30, 20, 10], and so on. This example has a cell for `HISTOGRAM(req_duration_ms)`.

```kusto
['http-logs']
| summarize histogram(req_duration_ms, 30)
```

```kusto
['githubpushevent']
| where _time > ago(7d)
| where repo contains "axiom"
| summarize count(), numCommits=sum(size) by _time=bin(_time, 3h), repo
| take 100
