## Introduction

The `summarize` operator in APL enables you to perform data aggregation and create summary tables from large datasets. You can use it to group data by specified fields and apply aggregation functions such as `count()`, `sum()`, `avg()`, `min()`, `max()`, and others. This is particularly useful when analyzing logs, tracing OpenTelemetry data, or reviewing security events. The `summarize` operator is helpful when you want to reduce the granularity of a dataset to extract insights or trends.

## For users of other query languages

If you use other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, the `stats` command performs a similar function to APL's `summarize` operator. Both operators are used to group data and apply aggregation functions. In APL, `summarize` is more explicit about the fields to group by and the aggregation functions to apply.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
index="sample-http-logs" | stats count by method
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize count() by method
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

The `summarize` operator in APL is conceptually similar to SQL's `GROUP BY` clause with aggregation functions. In APL, you explicitly specify the aggregation function (like `count()`, `sum()`) and the fields to group by.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT method, COUNT(*) 
FROM sample_http_logs 
GROUP BY method
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize count() by method
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
| summarize [[Field1 =] AggregationFunction [, ...]] [by [Field2 =] GroupExpression [, ...]]
```

### Parameters

- `Field1`: A field name.
- `AggregationFunction`: The aggregation function to apply. Examples include `count()`, `sum()`, `avg()`, `min()`, and `max()`.
- `GroupExpression`: A scalar expression that can reference the dataset.

### Returns

The `summarize` operator returns a table where:
- The input rows are arranged into groups having the same values of the `by` expressions.
- The specified aggregation functions are computed over each group, producing a row for each group.
- The result contains the `by` fields and at least one field for each computed aggregate. Some aggregation functions return multiple fields.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In log analysis, you can use `summarize` to count the number of HTTP requests grouped by method or to compute the average request duration.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize count() by method
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20count()%20by%20method%22%7D)

**Output**

| method | count_ |
|--------|--------|
| GET    | 1000   |
| POST   | 450    |

This query groups the HTTP requests by the `method` field and counts how many times each method is used.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

You can use `summarize` to analyze OpenTelemetry traces by calculating the average span duration for each service.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize avg(duration) by ['service.name']
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27otel-demo-traces%27%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20avg(duration)%20by%20%5B%27service.name%27%5D%22%7D)

**Output**

| service.name          | avg_duration |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| frontend              | 50ms         |
| cartservice           | 75ms         |

This query calculates the average duration of traces for each service in the dataset.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In security log analysis, `summarize` can help group events by status codes and show the distribution of HTTP responses.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize count() by status
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20count()%20by%20status%22%7D)

**Output**

| status | count_ |
|--------|--------|
| 200    | 1200   |
| 404    | 300    |

This query summarizes HTTP status codes, providing insight into the distribution of responses in your logs.

Returns a table that shows the heatmap in each interval [0, 30], [30, 20, 10], and so on. This example has a cell for `HISTOGRAM(req_duration_ms)`.

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
