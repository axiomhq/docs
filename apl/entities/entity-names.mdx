APL entities (datasets, tables, columns, and operators) are named. For example, two fields or columns in the same dataset can have the same name if the casing is different, and a table and a dataset may have the same name because they aren’t in the same scope.

## Columns

- Column names are case-sensitive for resolving purposes and they have a specific position in the dataset’s collection of columns.
- Column names are unique within a dataset and table.
- In queries, columns are generally referenced by name only. They can only appear in expressions, and the query operator under which the expression appears determines the table or tabular data stream.

## Identifier naming rules

Axiom uses identifiers to name various entities. Valid identifier names follow these rules:

- Between 1 and 1024 characters long.
- Allowed characters:
    - Alphanumeric characters (letters and digits)
    - Underscore (`_`)
    - Space (` `)
    - Dot (`.`)
    - Dash (`-`)

Identifier names are case-sensitive.

## Quote identifiers

Quote an identifier in your APL query if any of the following is true:

- The identifier name contains at least one of the following special characters:
    - Space (` `)
    - Dot (`.`)
    - Dash (`-`)
- The identifier name is identical to one of the reserved keywords of the APL query language. For example, `project` or `where`.

If any of the above is true, you must quote the identifier by enclosing it in quotation marks (`'` or `"`) and square brackets (`[]`). For example, `['my-field']`.

If none of the above is true, you don’t need to quote the identifier in your APL query. For example, `myfield`. In this case, quoting the identifier name is optional.
