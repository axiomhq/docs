APL entities (datasets, tables, columns, and operators) use distinct names. Entity names follow specific scoping rules. For example, two fields or columns in the same dataset can have the same name if they use different casing, and a table and dataset can share the same name because they exist in different scopes.

## Columns

- Column names are case-sensitive for resolving purposes and have a specific position in the dataset's collection of columns.
- Column names must be unique within a dataset and table.
- In queries, columns are referenced by name only. They can only appear in expressions, and the query operator under which the expression appears determines the table or tabular data stream.

## Identifier naming rules

Axiom uses identifiers to name various entities. Valid identifier names must follow these rules:

- Be between 1 and 1,024 characters long.
- Use only these allowed characters:
    - Alphanumeric characters (letters and digits)
    - Underscore (`_`)
    - Space (` `)
    - Dot (`.`)
    - Dash (`-`)

Identifier names are case-sensitive.

## Quote identifiers

Quote an identifier in your APL query if either of these conditions is true:

- The identifier name contains any of these special characters:
    - Space (` `)
    - Dot (`.`)
    - Dash (`-`)
- The identifier name matches an APL query language reserved keyword (for example, `project` or `where`).

If either condition is true, quote the identifier by enclosing it in quotation marks (`'`) and square brackets (`[]`). For example: `['my-field']`.

If neither condition is true, you don't need to quote the identifier in your APL query. For example: `myfield`. In this case, quoting the identifier name is optional.
