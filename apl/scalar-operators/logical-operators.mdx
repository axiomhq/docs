## Logical (binary) operators

The following logical operators are supported between two values of the `bool` type.

Note: Logical operators are also known as Boolean operators or binary operators. These terms are synonymous.

| Operator name | Syntax | Meaning |
| ------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Equality | `==` | Yields `true` if both operands are non-null and equal to each other. Otherwise, yields `false`. |
| Inequality | `!=` | Yields `true` if either one (or both) of the operands are null, or they are not equal to each other. Otherwise, yields `false`. |
| Logical AND | `and` | Yields `true` if both operands are `true`. Otherwise, yields `false`. |
| Logical OR | `or` | Yields `true` if at least one of the operands is `true`. Otherwise, yields `false`. |
