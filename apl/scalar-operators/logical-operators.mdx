## Logical (binary) operators

The following logical operators are supported between two values of the `bool` type:

**These logical operators are sometimes referred-to as Boolean operators, and sometimes as binary operators. The names are all synonyms.**

| **Operator name** | **Syntax** | **meaning**                                                                                                             |     |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Equality          | **==**       | Yields `true` if both operands are non-null and equal to each other. Otherwise, `false.`                                |
| Inequality        | **!=**       | Yields `true` if either one (or both) of the operands are null, or they are not equal to each other. Otherwise, `true.` |
| Logical and       | **and**        | Yields `true` if both operands are `true.`                                                                              |
| Logical or        | **or**       | Yields `true `if one of the operands is `true`, regardless of the other operand.                                        |
