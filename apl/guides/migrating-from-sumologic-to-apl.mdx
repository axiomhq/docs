## Introduction 

In the sphere of data analytics and log management, being able to query data efficiently and effectively is of paramount importance.

This guide dives into why APL could be a superior choice for your data needs, the differences between Sumo Logic and APL, and the potential benefits you could reap from migrating from Sumo Logic to APL. Let’s explore the compelling case for APL as a robust, powerful tool for handling your complex data querying requirements.

APL is powerful and flexible and uses a pipe (`|`) operator for chaining commands, and it provides a richer set of functions and operators for more complex queries.

## Benefits of Migrating from SumoLogic to APL 

- **Scalability and Performance:** APL was built with scalability in mind. It handles very large volumes of data more efficiently and provides quicker query execution compared to Sumo Logic, making it a suitable choice for organizations with extensive data requirements. APL is designed for high-speed data ingestion, real-time analytics, and providing insights across structured, semi-structured data. It’s also optimized for time-series data analysis, making it highly efficient for log and telemetry data.

- **Advanced Analytics Capabilities:** With APL’s support for aggregation and conversion functions and more advanced statistical visualization, organizations can derive more sophisticated insights from their data.

## Query Examples

Let’s see some examples of how to convert SumoLogic queries to APL.

## Parse, and Extract Operators

Extract `from` and `to` fields. For example, if a raw event contains `From: Jane To: John,` then `from=Jane and to=John.`

**Sumo Logic:** 
```bash
* | parse "From: * To: *" as (from, to)
```

**APL:** 

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend (method) == extract("From: (.*?) To: (.*)", 1, method)
```

## Extract Source IP with Regex

In this section, we will utilize a regular expression to identify the four octets of an IP address. This will help us efficiently extract the source IP addresses from the data.

**Sumo Logic:** 

```bash 
*| parse regex "(\<src_i\>\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})"
```

**APL:** 

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend ip = extract("(\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3})", 1, "23.45.67.90")
```

## Extract Visited URLs

This section focuses on identifying all URL addresses visited and extracting them to populate the "url" field. This method provides an organized way to track user activity using APL.

**Sumo Logic:**

```bash
_sourceCategory=apache 
| parse "GET * " as url
```

**APL:** 

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where method == "GET"
| project url = extract(@"(\w+)", 1, method)
```

## Extract Data from Source Category Traffic

This section aims to identify and analyze traffic originating from the Source Category. We will extract critical information including the source addresses, the sizes of messages transmitted, and the URLs visited, providing valuable insights into the nature of the traffic using APL.

**Sumo Logic:**

```bash
_sourceCategory=apache
| parse "* " as src_IP
| parse " 200 * " as size
| parse "GET * " as url
```

**APL:** 

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend src_IP = extract("^(\\S+)", 0, uri)
| extend size = extract("^(\\S+)", 1, status)
| extend url = extract("^(\\S+)", 1, method)
```

## Calculate Bytes Transferred per Source IP

In this part, we will compute the total number of bytes transferred to each source IP address. This will allow us to gauge the data volume associated with each source using APL.

**Sumo Logic:**

```bash
_sourceCategory=apache 
| parse "* " as src_IP 
| parse " 200 * " as size 
| count, sum(size) by src_IP
```

**APL:**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend src_IP = extract("^(\\S+)", 1, uri)
| extend size = toint(extract("200", 0, status))
| summarize count(), sum(size) by src_IP
```

## Compute Average HTTP Response Size

In this section, we will calculate the average size of all successful HTTP responses. This metric helps us to understand the typical data load associated with successful server responses.

**Sumo Logic:** 
```bash
_sourceCategory=apache 
| parse " 200 * " as size 
| avg(size)
```

**APL:** 

Get the average value from a string:

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend number = todouble(extract("\\d+(\\.\\d+)?", 0, status))
| summarize Average = avg(number)
```

## Extract Data with Missing Size Field (NoDrop)

This section focuses on extracting key parameters like `src`, `size`, and `URL`, even when the `size` field may be absent from the log message.

**Sumo Logic:** 

```bash
_sourceCategory=apache

| parse " 200 * " as size nodrop 
| parse "GET * " as url
```

**APL:**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']

## Hourly Status Code Count for "Text" Source

In this section, We aim to count instances by `status_code`, grouped into one-hour timeslices, and then transpose `status_code` to column format. This will help us understand the frequency and timing of different status codes.

**Sumo Logic:**

```bash
_sourceCategory=text*

| timeslice 1h
| count by _timeslice, status_code
| transpose row _timeslice column status_code

## Status Code Count in 5 Time Buckets

In this example, we will perform a count by 'status_code', sliced into five time buckets across the search results. This will help analyze the distribution and frequency of status codes over specific time intervals.

**Sumo Logic:** 

```bash
_sourceCategory=apache*
| parse "HTTP/1.1\" * * \"" as (status_code, size)
| timeslice 5 buckets
| count by _timeslice, status_code
```

**APL:**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where content_type startswith 'text/css'
| extend p=("HTTP/1.1\" * * \""), tostring( is_tls)
| extend status_code= status
| summarize count() by bin(_time, 12m), status_code
```

## Grouped Status Code Count

In this example, we will count messages by status code categories. We will group all messages with status codes in the `200s`, `300s`, `400s`, and `500s` together, we are also groupint the method requests with the `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` attributes. This will provide an overview of the response status distribution.

**Sumo Logic:**

```bash
_sourceCategory=Apache/Access
| timeslice 15m
| if (status_code matches "20*",1,0) as resp_200
| if (status_code matches "30*",1,0) as resp_300
| if (status_code matches "40*",1,0) as resp_400
| if (status_code matches "50*",1,0) as resp_500
| if (!(status_code matches "20*" or status_code matches "30*" or status_code matches "40*" or status_code matches "50*"),1,0) as resp_others
| count(*), sum(resp_200) as tot_200, sum(resp_300) as tot_300, sum(resp_400) as tot_400, sum(resp_500) as tot_500, sum(resp_others) as tot_others by _timeslice

## Extract Numeric Version Numbers

In this section, we will identify version numbers that match numeric values 2, 3, or 1. We will utilize the `num` operator to convert these strings into numerical format, facilitating easier analysis and comparison.

**Sumo Logic:**

```bash
* | parse "Version=*." as number | num(number)
| where number in (2,3,6)
```

**APL:**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend p= (req_duration_ms)
| extend number=toint(p)
| where number in (2,3,6)
```
