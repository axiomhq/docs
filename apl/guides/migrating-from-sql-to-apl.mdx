## Introduction 

As data grows exponentially, organizations are continuously seeking more efficient and powerful tools to manage and analyze their data. The Explore tab, which utilizes the Axiom Processing Language (APL), is one such service that offers fast, scalable, and interactive data exploration capabilities. If you are an SQL user looking to migrate to APL, this guide will provide a gentle introduction to help you make the transition smoothly.

**This tutorial will guide you through migrating SQL to APL, helping you understand key differences and providing you with query examples.**

## Introduction to Axiom Processing Language (APL)

Axiom Processing Language (APL) is the language used by the Explore tab, a fast and highly scalable data exploration service. APL is optimized for real-time and historical data analytics, making it a suitable choice for various data analysis tasks.

**Tabular operators**: In APL, there are several tabular operators that help you manipulate and filter data, similar to SQL’s SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY clauses. Some of the commonly used tabular operators are: 

- `extend`: Adds new columns to the result set.
- `project`: Selects specific columns from the result set.
- `where`: Filters rows based on a condition.
- `summarize`: Groups and aggregates data similar to the GROUP BY clause in SQL.
- `sort`: Sorts the result set based on one or more columns, similar to ORDER BY in SQL.

## Key differences between SQL and APL 

While SQL and APL are query languages, there are some key differences to consider: 

- APL is designed for querying large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- APL is a pipe-based language, meaning you can chain multiple operations using the pipe operator (`|`) to create a data transformation flow.
- APL doesn’t use SELECT, and FROM clauses like SQL. Instead, it uses keywords such as summarize, extend, where, and project.
- APL is case-sensitive, whereas SQL isn’t.

## Benefits of migrating from SQL to APL: 

- **Time Series Analysis:** APL is particularly strong when it comes to analyzing time-series data (logs, telemetry data, etc.). It has a rich set of operators designed specifically for such scenarios, making it much easier to handle time-based analysis.

- **Pipelining:** APL uses a pipelining model, much like the UNIX command line. You can chain commands together using the pipe (`|`) symbol, with each command operating on the results of the previous command. This makes it very easy to write complex queries.

- **Easy to Learn:** APL is designed to be simple and easy to learn, especially for those already familiar with SQL. It does not require any knowledge of database schemas or the need to specify joins.

- **Scalability:** APL is a more scalable platform than SQL. This means that it can handle larger amounts of data.

- **Flexibility:** APL is a more flexible platform than SQL. This means that it can be used to analyze different types of data.

- **Features:** APL offers more features and capabilities than SQL. This includes features such as real-time analytics,  and time-based analysis.

## Basic APL Syntax 

A basic APL query follows this structure: 

```kusto
| <DatasetName>
| <FilteringOperation> 
| <ProjectionOperation> 
| <AggregationOperation>
```

## Query Examples 

Let’s see some examples of how to convert SQL queries to APL.

## SELECT with a simple filter 

**SQL:** 

```sql
SELECT *
FROM [Sample-http-logs]
WHERE method = 'GET';
```

**APL:** 

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where method == 'GET'
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm={%22apl%22:%22[%27sample-http-logs%27]\n|%20where%20method%20==%20%27GET%27%22,%22queryOptions%22:{%22quickRange%22:%2230d%22}})

## COUNT with GROUP BY

**SQL:** 

```sql
SELECT Country, COUNT(*)
FROM [Sample-http-logs]
GROUP BY method;
```

**APL:** 

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize count() by method
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm={%22apl%22:%22[%27sample-http-logs%27]\n|%20summarize%20count()%20by%20method%22,%22queryOptions%22:{%22quickRange%22:%2230d%22}})

## Top N results

**SQL:** 

```sql
SELECT TOP 10 Status, Method
FROM [Sample-http-logs]
ORDER BY Method DESC;
```

**APL:** 

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| top 10 by method desc
| project status, method
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm={%22apl%22:%22[%27sample-http-logs%27]\n|top%2010%20by%20method%20desc%20\n|%20project%20status,%20method%22,%22queryOptions%22:{%22quickRange%22:%2215d%22}})

## Simple filtering and projection

**SQL:**
