description: 'This page explains how to use the ingestion_time function in APL.'
---

Use the `ingestion_time` function to retrieve the timestamp of when each record was ingested into Axiom. This function helps you distinguish between the original event time (as captured in the `_time` field) and the time the data was actually received by Axiom.

You can use `ingestion_time` to:

- Detect delays or lags in data ingestion.
- Filter events based on their ingestion window.
- Audit data pipelines by comparing event time with ingestion time.

This function is especially useful when working with streaming or event-based data sources where ingestion delays are common and might affect alerting, dashboarding, or correlation accuracy.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

Splunk provides the `_indextime` field, which represents when an event was indexed. In APL, the equivalent concept is accessed using the `ingestion_time` function, which must be called explicitly.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
... | eval ingest_time=_indextime
````

```kusto APL equivalent
...
| extend ingest_time = ingestion_time()
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

ANSI SQL does not have a standard equivalent to `ingestion_time`, since SQL databases typically do not distinguish ingestion time from event time. APL provides `ingestion_time` for observability-specific workflows where the arrival time of data is important.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT event_time, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS ingest_time FROM logs;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| extend ingest_time = ingestion_time()
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
ingestion_time()
```

### Parameters

This function does not take any parameters.

### Returns

A `datetime` value that represents when each record was ingested into Axiom.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

Use `ingestion_time` to identify delays between when an HTTP request occurred and when it was ingested into Axiom.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend ingest_time = ingestion_time()
| extend delay = datetime_diff('second', ingest_time, _time)
| where delay > 1
| project _time, ingest_time, delay, method, uri, status
```

**Output**

| _time               | ingest_time         | delay | method | uri           | status |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------------- | ------ |

This query calculates the difference between the ingestion time and event time, highlighting entries with more than 60 seconds delay.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

Use `ingestion_time` to monitor ingestion lags for spans generated by services, helping identify pipeline slowdowns or delivery issues.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| extend ingest_time = ingestion_time()
| extend delay = datetime_diff('second', ingest_time, _time)
| summarize avg_delay = avg(delay) by ['service.name'], kind
| order by avg_delay desc
```

**Output**

| service.name    | kind     | avg_delay |

| cartservice     | client   | 30         |
| frontend        | internal | 12         |

This query calculates the average ingestion delay per service and kind to identify services affected by delayed ingestion.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

Use `ingestion_time` to identify recently ingested suspicious activity, even if the event occurred earlier.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend ingest_time = ingestion_time()
| where status == '401' and ingest_time > ago(1h)
| project _time, ingest_time, id, method, uri, ['geo.country']
```
