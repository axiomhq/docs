description: 'This page explains how to use the series_min function in APL.'
---

The `series_min` function returns the minimum value from each numeric dynamic array (series). This function scans through all elements in the series and identifies the lowest value present.

You can use `series_min` when you need to find the smallest values in time-series data. This is particularly useful for identifying minimum resource utilization, fastest response times, lowest transaction volumes, or other scenarios where you need to determine the lower bound of measurements across a series.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, you typically use the `min()` function to find minimum values across multiple fields or events. In APL, `series_min` operates on dynamic arrays, returning the minimum value from each array in a single operation.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
... | stats min(response_time) as fastest_time by user
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize times = make_list(req_duration_ms) by id
| extend fastest_time = series_min(times)
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In SQL, you use the `MIN()` aggregate function to find the minimum value across rows. In APL, `series_min` operates on individual arrays, extracting the minimum value from each array element-wise.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT user_id, MIN(response_time) AS fastest_time
FROM requests
GROUP BY user_id;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize times = make_list(req_duration_ms) by id
| extend fastest_time = series_min(times)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
series_min(array)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type    | Description                        |

| `array`   | dynamic | A dynamic array of numeric values. |

### Returns

A numeric scalar representing the minimum value in the input array.

In log analysis, you can use `series_min` to identify the fastest request duration for each user, helping you understand the best-case performance.

**Query**

```kusto

In OpenTelemetry traces, you can use `series_min` to find the minimum span duration for each service, establishing performance benchmarks.

**Query**

```kusto

| summarize durations = make_list(duration_ms) by ['service.name']
| extend min_duration = series_min(durations)
| project ['service.name'], min_duration
```

**Output**

| service.name | min_duration |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| frontend     | 15           |
| checkout     | 22           |

This query aggregates span durations per service and identifies the fastest span for each service, useful for setting performance targets.

In security logs, you can use `series_min` to identify the shortest request duration for each HTTP status code, helping establish normal behavior patterns.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize durations = make_list(req_duration_ms) by status
| extend min_duration = series_min(durations)
| project status, min_duration
