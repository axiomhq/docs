description: 'This page explains how to use the series_fill_const function in APL.'
---

The `series_fill_const` function fills missing values (nulls) in a numeric dynamic array (series) with a specified constant value. This function is useful for handling gaps in time series data where you want to replace missing data points with a known default value.

You can use `series_fill_const` when you have time series data with missing values and want to fill gaps with a specific constant value, such as zero, a default threshold, or a neutral value. This is particularly useful when missing values represent a specific state (like no activity, default configuration, or baseline values). Typical applications include financial data analysis, sensor data processing, and performance monitoring where a specific default value is meaningful.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, filling missing values with constants is typically done with the `fillnull` command or `eval` expressions using conditional logic. To fill arrays with constants, you usually need to expand arrays and apply the transformation row by row. In APL, `series_fill_const` works directly on dynamic arrays, making it efficient for series-wide constant filling.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
... | fillnull value=0 field_name
````

```kusto APL equivalent
datatable(values: dynamic)
[
  dynamic([null, 100, null, 200])
]
| extend filled_values = series_fill_const(values, 0)
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In SQL, filling missing values with constants is typically done with `COALESCE()` or `ISNULL()` functions, but these only work on single values, not arrays. To fill array elements with constants, you usually need to unnest arrays and apply the function row by row. In APL, `series_fill_const` eliminates this complexity by directly replacing null values with a constant in arrays.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT COALESCE(value, 0) AS filled_value
FROM measurements;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
datatable(values: dynamic)
[
  dynamic([null, 100, null, 200])
]
| extend filled_values = series_fill_const(values, 0)
```

<Tab title="Log analysis">

In log analysis, you can use `series_fill_const` to fill missing request duration data with a default value like 0, which might represent no activity or baseline performance.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize durations = make_list(req_duration_ms) by id
| extend filled_durations = series_fill_const(durations, 0)
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20durations%20%3D%20make_list(req_duration_ms)%20by%20id%20%7C%20extend%20filled_durations%20%3D%20series_fill_const(durations%2C%200)%22%7D)

**Output**

| id   | durations           | filled_durations    |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| u123 | [null, 150, null, 200] | [0, 150, 0, 200] |
| u456 | [100, null, null, 300] | [100, 0, 0, 300] |

This query fills missing request durations with 0, useful for representing periods of no activity or baseline performance.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

In OpenTelemetry traces, you can use `series_fill_const` to fill missing span duration data with a default value, such as 0 for spans that didn't execute or a baseline latency value.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize durations = make_list(duration) by ['service.name']
| extend filled_durations = series_fill_const(durations, 0)
```

| productcatalogservice | [50ms, null, null, 150ms]  | [50ms, 0ms, 0ms, 150ms] |

This query fills missing span durations with 0ms, useful for representing spans that didn't execute or had no measurable duration.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In security logs, you can use `series_fill_const` to fill missing request duration data with a default value, such as 0 for blocked requests or a baseline value for analysis.

**Query**

```kusto
