title: series_ifft
description: 'This page explains how to use the series_ifft function in APL.'
---

The `series_ifft` function performs an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) on a numeric dynamic array (series), converting frequency-domain data back into time-domain representation. This function is the inverse operation of `series_fft` and is essential for reconstructing signals from their frequency components.

You can use `series_ifft` when you want to reconstruct time-domain signals from frequency-domain data, implement frequency-domain filtering, or perform signal synthesis. This is particularly useful after applying frequency-domain operations like filtering or when you need to convert processed frequency data back to the original time domain. Typical applications include signal reconstruction, frequency-domain filtering, noise reduction, and advanced signal processing workflows.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, IFFT operations arenâ€™t natively available and typically require external tools or complex workarounds. Most Splunk users rely on statistical functions and time-based aggregations for signal reconstruction. In APL, `series_ifft` provides direct access to inverse frequency domain analysis, enabling sophisticated signal reconstruction capabilities.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
... | timechart span=1m avg(duration) by service
````

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize fft_data = make_list(complex_value) by bin(_time, 1m)
| extend reconstructed_signal = series_ifft(fft_data)
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

ANSI SQL does not provide IFFT functionality. Database systems typically require specialized extensions or external libraries for inverse frequency domain analysis. Most SQL users rely on window functions and statistical aggregations for signal reconstruction. In APL, `series_ifft` brings advanced inverse signal processing capabilities directly into the query language.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT AVG(duration) as avg_duration
FROM requests
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('minute', timestamp);
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize fft_data = make_list(complex_value) by bin(_time, 1m)
| extend reconstructed_signal = series_ifft(fft_data)
```
