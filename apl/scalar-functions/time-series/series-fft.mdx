---

The `series_fft` function performs a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on a numeric dynamic array (series), converting time-domain data into frequency-domain representation. This function is essential for signal processing, frequency analysis, and identifying periodic patterns in time series data.

You can use `series_fft` when you want to analyze the frequency components of your data, detect periodic patterns, or perform spectral analysis. Typical applications include identifying seasonal patterns in logs, detecting anomalies in telemetry data, analyzing network traffic patterns, and performing signal processing on time series data.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, FFT operations aren’t natively available and typically require external tools or complex workarounds. Most Splunk users rely on statistical functions and time-based aggregations for pattern analysis. In APL, `series_fft` provides direct access to frequency domain analysis, enabling sophisticated signal processing capabilities.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

ANSI SQL doesn’t provide FFT functionality. Database systems typically require specialized extensions or external libraries for frequency domain analysis. Most SQL users rely on window functions and statistical aggregations for time series analysis. In APL, `series_fft` brings advanced signal processing capabilities directly into the query language.

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
series_fft(array)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type    | Description                        |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `array`   | dynamic | A dynamic array of real numeric values representing time series data. |

### Returns

A dynamic array of complex numbers representing the frequency domain representation of the input time series.

## Example

Use `series_fft` to identify periodic patterns in request durations, such as daily or hourly cycles in application performance.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize durations = make_list(req_duration_ms) by bin(_time, 1h)
| extend fft_analysis = series_fft(durations)
```
