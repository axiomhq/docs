---

The `ipv4_compare` function in APL allows you to compare two IPv4 addresses lexicographically or numerically. This is useful for sorting IP addresses, validating CIDR ranges, or detecting overlaps between IP ranges. Itâ€™s particularly helpful in analyzing network logs, performing security investigations, and managing IP-based filters or rules.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, similar functionality can be achieved using `sort` or custom commands. In APL, `ipv4_compare` is a dedicated function for comparing two IPv4 addresses.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| eval comparison = if(ip1 < ip2, -1, if(ip1 == ip2, 0, 1))
```

```kusto APL equivalent
| extend comparison = ipv4_compare(ip1, ip2)
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, you might manually parse or order IP addresses as strings. In APL, `ipv4_compare` simplifies this task with built-in support for IPv4 comparison.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT CASE 
  WHEN ip1 < ip2 THEN -1
  WHEN ip1 = ip2 THEN 0
  ELSE 1
END AS comparison
FROM ips;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| extend comparison = ipv4_compare(ip1, ip2)
```

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
ipv4_compare(ip1: string, ip2: string)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                      |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `ip1`     | string | The first IPv4 address to compare.               |
| `ip2`     | string | The second IPv4 address to compare.              |

### Returns

- `-1` if `ip1` is less than `ip2`
- `0` if `ip1` is equal to `ip2`
- `1` if `ip1` is greater than `ip2`

## Use case example

You can use `ipv4_compare` to sort logs based on IP addresses or to identify connections between specific IPs.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend ip1 = '192.168.1.1', ip2 = '192.168.1.10'
| extend comparison = ipv4_compare(ip1, ip2)
```

**Output**

| ip1         | ip2          | comparison |
|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 192.168.1.1 | 192.168.1.10 | -1         |

This query compares two hardcoded IP addresses. It returns `-1`, indicating that `192.168.1.1` is lexicographically less than `192.168.1.10`.
