description: 'This page explains how to use the geo_info_from_ip_address function in APL.'
---

The `geo_info_from_ip_address` function in APL retrieves geographic information based on an IP address. It maps an IP address to attributes such as city, region, and country, allowing you to perform location-based analytics on your datasets. This function is particularly useful for analyzing web logs, security events, and telemetry data to uncover geographic trends or detect anomalies based on location.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk, the equivalent process often involves using lookup tables or add-ons to resolve IP addresses into geographic details. In APL, `geo_info_from_ip_address` performs the resolution natively within the query, streamlining the workflow.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| eval geo_info = iplocation(client_ip)
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| extend geo_info = geo_info_from_ip_address(client_ip)
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In SQL, geographic information retrieval typically requires a separate database or API integration. In APL, the `geo_info_from_ip_address` function directly provides geographic details, simplifying the query process.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT ip_to_location(client_ip) AS geo_info
FROM sample_http_logs
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| extend geo_info = geo_info_from_ip_address(client_ip)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
geo_info_from_ip_address(ip_address)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter   | Type   | Description                                  |
|-------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| `ip_address` | string | The IP address for which to retrieve geographic information. |

### Returns

A dynamic object containing the IP addressâ€™s geographic attributes (if available). The object contains the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| country | string | Country name |
| state | string | State (subdivision) name |
| city | string | City name |
| latitude | real | Latitude coordinate |
| longitude | real | Longitude coordinate |
| country_iso | string | ISO code of the country |
| time_zone | string | Time zone in which the IP address is located |

## Use case example

Use geographic data to analyze web log traffic.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
