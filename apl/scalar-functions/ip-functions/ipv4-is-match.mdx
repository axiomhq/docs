---

The `ipv4_is_match` function in APL helps you determine whether a given IPv4 address matches a specific IPv4 pattern. This function is especially useful for tasks that involve IP address filtering, including network security analyses, log file inspections, and geo-locational data processing. By specifying patterns that include wildcards or CIDR notations, you can efficiently check if an IP address falls within defined ranges or meets specific conditions.

The `ipv4_is_match` function in APL resembles the `cidrmatch` function in Splunk SPL. Both functions assess whether an IP address falls within a designated CIDR range, but `ipv4_is_match` also supports wildcard pattern matching, providing additional flexibility.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
cidrmatch("192.168.1.0/24", ip)
```

```kusto APL equivalent
ipv4_is_match(ip, "192.168.1.0/24")
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

ANSI SQL lacks a direct equivalent to the `ipv4_is_match` function, but you can replicate similar functionality with a combination of `LIKE` and range checking. However, these approaches can be complex and less efficient than `ipv4_is_match`, which simplifies CIDR and wildcard-based IP matching.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
ip LIKE '192.168.1.0'
```

```kusto APL equivalent
ipv4_is_match(ip, "192.168.1.0")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
ipv4_is_match(ipaddress1, ipaddress2, prefix)
```

### Parameters

- **ipaddress1**: A string representing the first IPv4 address you want to evaluate. Use CIDR notation (for example, `192.168.1.0/24`).
- **ipaddress2**: A string representing the second IPv4 address you want to evaluate. Use CIDR notation (for example, `192.168.1.0/24`).
- **prefix**: Optionally, a number between 0 and 32 that specifies the number of most-significant bits taken into account.

### Returns

- `true` if the IPv4 addresses match.
- `false` otherwise.
- `null` if the conversion of an IPv4 string wasnâ€™t successful.

## Use case example

The `ipv4_is_match` function allows you to identify traffic based on IP addresses, enabling faster identification of traffic patterns and potential issues.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend is_match = ipv4_is_match('203.0.113.112', '203.0.113.112')
```
