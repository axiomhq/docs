---

Use the `ipv6_compare` function to compare two IPv6 addresses and determine their relative order. This function helps you evaluate whether one address is less than, equal to, or greater than another. It returns `-1`, `0`, or `1` accordingly.

You can use `ipv6_compare` in scenarios where IPv6 addresses are relevant, such as sorting traffic logs, grouping metrics by address ranges, or identifying duplicate or misordered entries. It’s especially useful in network observability and security use cases where working with IPv6 is common.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

Splunk SPL doesn’t have a built-in function for directly comparing IPv6 addresses. Users often work around this limitation by converting the addresses into a comparable numeric format using external scripts or custom commands.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| eval ip1 = "2001:db8::1", ip2 = "2001:db8::2"
| eval comparison = if(ip1 == ip2, 0, if(ip1 < ip2, -1, 1))
````

```kusto APL equivalent
print comparison = ipv6_compare('2001:db8::1', '2001:db8::2')
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

ANSI SQL doesn’t natively support IPv6 comparisons. Typically, users must store IPv6 addresses as strings or binary values and write custom logic to compare them.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT CASE
  WHEN ip1 = ip2 THEN 0
  WHEN ip1 < ip2 THEN -1
  ELSE 1
END AS comparison
FROM my_table
```

```kusto APL equivalent
print comparison = ipv6_compare('2001:db8::1', '2001:db8::2')
```

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
ipv6_compare(ipv6_1, ipv6_2)
```

### Parameters

| Name     | Type   | Description                         |
| -------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `ipv6_1` | string | The first IPv6 address to compare.  |
| `ipv6_2` | string | The second IPv6 address to compare. |

### Returns

An integer that represents the result of the comparison:

- `-1` if `ipv6_1` is less than `ipv6_2`
- `0` if `ipv6_1` is equal to `ipv6_2`
- `1` if `ipv6_1` is greater than `ipv6_2`

## Example

Use `ipv6_compare` to identify whether requests from certain IPv6 addresses fall into specific ranges or appear out of expected order.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend comparison = ipv6_compare('2001:db8::1', '2001:db8::abcd')
| project _time, uri, method, status, comparison
```

**Output**

| _time               | uri         | method | status | comparison |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| 2025-06-29T22:10:00Z | /products/1 | GET    | 200    | -1         |

This example compares two static IPv6 addresses and attaches the result to each row for further filtering or grouping.

## List of related functions

- [ipv6_is_match](/apl/scalar-functions/ip-functions/ipv6-is-match): Checks if an IPv6 address matches a given subnet. Use it for range filtering instead of sorting or comparison.
- [ipv4_is_private](/apl/scalar-functions/ip-functions/ipv4-is-private): Determines whether an IPv4 address is in a private range. Use this to filter non-public traffic.
- [ipv4_compare](/apl/scalar-functions/ip-functions/ipv4-compare): Works the same way as `ipv6_compare` but for IPv4 addresses. Use it when your data contains IPv4 instead of IPv6.
