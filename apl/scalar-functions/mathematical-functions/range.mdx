---

Use the `range` function in APL to generate a sequence of values across a numeric or time interval. You can use `range` to construct tables without referencing a dataset. This is especially helpful when you need to create synthetic data for visualizations, simulate values for testing, or build time series intervals for joining with real data.

The function supports sequences of integers, real numbers, and timestamps. Each row in the resulting table represents one step in the generated range.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

APL’s `range` function is similar to using `makeresults` in combination with `streamstats` or generating time windows manually. However, `range` in APL offers a direct way to create sequences without needing a dataset as input.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| makeresults count=10
| streamstats count as x
````

```kusto APL equivalent
range x from 1 to 10 step 1
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

APL’s `range` function replaces the need to use recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in ANSI SQL to generate sequences. The syntax is simpler and does not require joins or unions.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
WITH RECURSIVE seq AS (
  SELECT 1 AS x
  UNION ALL
  SELECT x + 1 FROM seq WHERE x < 10
)
SELECT * FROM seq;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
range x from 1 to 10 step 1
```

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
range <ColumnName> from <StartValue> to <EndValue> step <StepValue>
```

### Parameters

| Name         | Type                         | Description                                                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ColumnName` | `string`                     | Name of the column to use in the output table.                                 |
| `StartValue` | `int`, `real`, or `datetime` | First value in the generated sequence.                                         |
| `EndValue`   | `int`, `real`, or `datetime` | Last value in the sequence. If `step` moves past this value, generation stops. |
| `StepValue`  | `int`, `real`, or `timespan` | Amount by which the value is incremented for each row.                         |

### Returns

A table with one column named `<ColumnName>` and one row per step. The type of the column depends on the types of the start, end, and step values.

<Tab title="Log analysis">

Create a reference table of durations to compare against HTTP request durations.

**Query**

```kusto
range duration_threshold from 100 to 500 step 100
```

[Run in Playground]([https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22range](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22range) duration_threshold from 100 to 500 step 100%22%7D)

**Output**

| duration_threshold |
| ------------------- |
| 100                 |
| 200                 |
| 300                 |
| 400                 |
| 500                 |

This creates a list of duration thresholds that you can use in joins or comparisons to classify requests in the `['sample-http-logs']` dataset.

Generate a list of 15-second intervals over a specific hour to analyze service span density.

**Query**

```kusto
range time_bucket from datetime(2025-07-29T12:00:00Z) to datetime(2025-07-29T13:00:00Z) step 15s
```

**Output**

| time_bucket         |
| -------------------- |
| 2025-07-29T12:00:00Z |
| 2025-07-29T12:00:15Z |

| ...                  |
| 2025-07-29T12:59:45Z |

This produces a time series that you can use to join with data in `['otel-demo-traces']` for visualizations or aggregations.

Build a synthetic set of user IDs to use for access pattern lookups.

**Query**

```kusto
range id from 1 to 5 step 1
| extend id = strcat('user-', tostring(id))
```

**Output**

| id     |
| ------ |
| user-1 |
| user-2 |
| user-3 |
| user-4 |
| user-5 |

This creates a temporary table of synthetic user IDs that you can use to match or simulate logins in `['sample-http-logs']`.
