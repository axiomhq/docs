---

Use the `set_difference` function in APL to compute the distinct elements in one array that are not present in another. This function helps you filter out shared values between two arrays, producing a new array that includes only the unique values from the first input array.

Use `set_difference` when you need to identify new or missing elements, such as:

- Users who visited today but not yesterday.
- Error codes that occurred in one region but not another.
- Service calls that appear in staging but not production.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, similar logic often uses the `setdiff` function from the `mv` (multivalue) function family. APL’s `set_difference` behaves similarly, returning values that are only in the first multivalue field.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| eval a=mvappend("a", "b", "c"), b=mvappend("b", "c")
| eval diff=mvfilter(NOT match(a, b))
````

```kusto APL equivalent
print a=dynamic(['a', 'b', 'c']), b=dynamic(['b', 'c'])
| extend diff=set_difference(a, b)
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

ANSI SQL doesn’t support array operations directly, but you can emulate set difference with `EXCEPT` when working with rows, not arrays. APL provides native array functions like `set_difference` for this purpose.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT value FROM array1
EXCEPT
SELECT value FROM array2;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
print a=dynamic(['a', 'b', 'c']), b=dynamic(['b', 'c'])
| extend diff=set_difference(a, b)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
set_difference(Array1, Array2)
```

### Parameters

| Name     | Type  | Description                                          |
| -------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `Array1` | array | The array to subtract from.                          |
| `Array2` | array | The array containing values to remove from `Array1`. |

### Returns

An array that includes all values from `Array1` that are not present in `Array2`. The result does not include duplicates.

## Use case example

Use `set_difference` to return the difference between two arrays.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend difference = set_difference(dynamic([1, 2, 3]), dynamic([2, 3, 4, 5]))
```
