Use the `rand` function in APL to generate pseudo-random numbers between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). This function is useful when you want to introduce randomness into your queries—for example, to sample a subset of data, generate test data, or simulate probabilistic scenarios. 

Because `rand` returns a different value on each row, it’s especially helpful when you need to randomize the results of a table scan or perform probabilistic filtering. You can also pass a seed to the function for deterministic outputs, which is helpful for reproducibility.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, the `random()` function returns a pseudo-random integer between 0 and 2^31-1. You often divide this value to produce a float between 0 and 1. In APL, the `rand()` function directly returns a float in the range `[0, 1)`, so there’s no need to divide or scale.

```sql Splunk example
| eval r=random()/2147483647

```kusto APL equivalent
print r = rand()
```

<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

ANSI SQL uses the `RAND()` function to generate a float between 0 and 1. However, SQL typically doesn’t generate a new random value for every row unless you call `RAND()` inside a subquery or use it with a specific expression. In APL, `rand()` behaves like a row-level function and produces a new value for each row automatically.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT RAND() as r;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
print r = rand()
```

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
rand()
rand(seed)
```

### Parameters

| Name   | Type            | Description                                                                                       |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `seed` | real (optional) | A number that initializes the random number generator. Use this if you want reproducible results. |

### Returns

A real number in the range `[0, 1)`. Each call returns a pseudo-random float. If a seed is specified, the sequence of random numbers is repeatable.

## Example

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
