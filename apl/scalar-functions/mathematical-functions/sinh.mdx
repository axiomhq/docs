The `sinh` function returns the hyperbolic sine of a numeric expression. Hyperbolic sine is defined mathematically as:

```

sinh(x) = (e^x – e^(–x)) / 2

````

Use `sinh` when you need to work with hyperbolic functions in mathematical, scientific, or engineering analyses. It is useful in scenarios such as:

- Modeling waveforms or oscillations.
- Performing geometric or trigonometric calculations in physics simulations.
- Transforming data in machine learning or data analysis pipelines that involve hyperbolic functions.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, you can calculate the hyperbolic sine using the `sinh()` function in `eval` expressions. In APL, `sinh` behaves the same way but is applied as a scalar function inside your expressions.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
... | eval result = sinh(2)
````

```kusto APL equivalent
print result = sinh(2)
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

ANSI SQL does not define `sinh` as part of its standard functions. Many SQL dialects (such as PostgreSQL or MySQL) support it as a mathematical function. In APL, the syntax is simpler and directly applies `sinh` to your numeric expression.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT SINH(2) AS result;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
print result = sinh(2)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
sinh(x)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                           |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `x`       | number | The numeric value to compute the hyperbolic sine for. |

### Returns

A `real` value representing the hyperbolic sine of the input.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

You can use `sinh` to apply a mathematical transformation to a numeric log field, for example to amplify differences in HTTP request durations for anomaly detection.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend duration_sinh = sinh(req_duration_ms / 1000.0)
| project _time, req_duration_ms, duration_sinh
```

[Run in Playground]

**Output**

| _time               | req_duration_ms | duration_sinh |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| 2025-08-10T12:00:00Z | 120               | 0.201336       |
| 2025-08-10T12:01:00Z | 350               | 0.358357       |

This query transforms request durations from milliseconds to seconds and computes their hyperbolic sine, making small differences in durations more distinguishable.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

In OpenTelemetry traces, `sinh` can help scale span durations in a way that emphasizes longer-running spans for analysis.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| extend duration_ms = toreal(totimespan(duration)) / 1000000
| extend duration_sinh = sinh(duration_ms / 1000.0)
| project _time, service.name, span_id, duration_ms, duration_sinh
```

[Run in Playground]

**Output**

| _time               | service.name          | span_id | duration_ms | duration_sinh |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| 2025-08-10T14:15:00Z | checkoutservice       | a1b2c3d4 | 250          | 0.252569       |
| 2025-08-10T14:16:00Z | productcatalogservice | e5f6g7h8 | 800          | 0.888106       |

The query calculates the hyperbolic sine of the span duration in seconds, making slow spans stand out more for further analysis.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In security log analysis, you can use `sinh` to emphasize large deviations in request durations, which can help detect unusual activity.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where status == '200'
| extend duration_sinh = sinh(req_duration_ms / 1000.0)
| project _time, id, uri, req_duration_ms, duration_sinh
```

[Run in Playground]

**Output**

| _time               | id     | uri       | req_duration_ms | duration_sinh |
| -------------------- | ------ | --------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| 2025-08-10T15:00:00Z | u12345 | /login    | 500               | 0.521095       |
| 2025-08-10T15:05:00Z | u54321 | /checkout | 1200              | 1.509461       |

This query filters successful requests, computes their hyperbolic sine, and can help flag requests that are significantly slower than usual.
