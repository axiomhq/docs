description: 'This page explains how to use the asinh function in APL.'
---

The `asinh` function returns the inverse hyperbolic sine of a numeric expression.  
You can use `asinh` when you want to transform data that follows a hyperbolic pattern or to solve equations involving hyperbolic functions.  
It is particularly useful when working with data that covers a wide range of magnitudes, such as in signal processing, statistical modeling, or scientific measurements, because it handles both small and large values gracefully.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, you can use the `asinh()` function in `eval` expressions to compute the inverse hyperbolic sine of a field or number. In APL, the `asinh` function works similarly, but you use it directly in the expression without the `eval` command.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
... | eval result=asinh(value)
````

```kusto APL equivalent
datatable(value: real) [
    -2.5, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.5
]
| extend result = asinh(value)
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, the inverse hyperbolic sine function is usually available as `ASINH()` in mathematical expressions. In APL, the name and usage are the same, but you use it in the pipeline syntax.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT ASINH(value) AS result
FROM my_table;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
datatable(value: real) [
    -2.5, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.5
]
| extend result = asinh(value)
```

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
asinh(x)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description                                                 |
| --------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x`       | real | The value for which to compute the inverse hyperbolic sine. |

### Returns

A value of type `real` that represents the inverse hyperbolic sine of `x`.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

You can use `asinh` to normalize large variations in request durations, making it easier to visualize and compare outliers.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend norm_duration = asinh(req_duration_ms)
| project _time, req_duration_ms, norm_duration, id, status
```

[Run in Playground]

**Output**

| _time               | req_duration_ms | norm_duration | id      | status |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ------- | ------ |
| 2025-08-01T10:00:00Z | 10                | 2.998223       | user123 | 200    |
| 2025-08-01T10:05:00Z | 1500              | 7.313220       | user456 | 500    |

This query computes the inverse hyperbolic sine of each request duration, producing a normalized metric that compresses large spikes in values.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

When analyzing spans, you can use `asinh` to transform duration values, which helps when some spans are significantly longer than others.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| extend norm_duration = asinh(toint(duration / 1ms))
| project _time, duration, norm_duration, ['service.name'], kind, status_code
```

[Run in Playground]

**Output**

| _time               | duration | norm_duration | service.name    | kind     | status_code |
| -------------------- | -------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| 2025-08-01T11:00:00Z | 2ms      | 1.443635       | frontend        | server   | 200          |
| 2025-08-01T11:02:00Z | 1500ms   | 7.313220       | checkoutservice | internal | 500          |

This query normalizes the `duration` field in milliseconds to reduce the effect of very large spans.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

For security-related requests, you can use `asinh` to transform duration data for anomaly detection, where very large durations can skew averages.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend norm_duration = asinh(req_duration_ms)
| where status == '500'
| project _time, req_duration_ms, norm_duration, id, uri, method, ['geo.city'], ['geo.country']
```

[Run in Playground]

**Output**

| _time               | req_duration_ms | norm_duration | id      | uri    | method | geo.city | geo.country |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| 2025-08-01T12:00:00Z | 3000              | 8.699515       | user789 | /login | POST   | Berlin   | DE          |

This query focuses on failed requests and normalizes their request durations, making it easier to identify anomalies in high-latency error events.
