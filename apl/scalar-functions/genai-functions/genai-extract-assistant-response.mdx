description: 'This page explains how to use the genai_extract_assistant_response function in APL.'
---

The `genai_extract_assistant_response` function extracts the assistant’s response from a GenAI messages array. It returns the content of the last message with the 'assistant' role, which typically contains the AI model’s generated response to the user.

You can use this function to analyze AI responses, evaluate response quality, perform sentiment analysis on AI outputs, or track specific response patterns for monitoring and debugging.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, you would need to use complex eval statements with mvfilter and mvindex to extract assistant messages.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| eval assistant_msgs=mvfilter(match(role, "assistant"))
| eval response=mvindex(assistant_msgs, -1)
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['ai-logs']
| extend response = genai_extract_assistant_response(messages)
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, you would need to unnest arrays, filter by role, and select the last message, which is more verbose.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT 
  conversation_id,
  content as assistant_response
FROM (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY conversation_id ORDER BY msg_index DESC) as rn
  FROM conversations
  CROSS JOIN UNNEST(messages) WITH OFFSET AS msg_index
  WHERE role = 'assistant'
) WHERE rn = 1
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['ai-logs']
| extend assistant_response = genai_extract_assistant_response(messages)
```
</CodeGroup>

</AccordionGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
genai_extract_assistant_response(messages)
```

### Parameters

- **messages** (dynamic, required): An array of message objects from a GenAI conversation. Each message typically contains `role` and `content` fields.

### Returns

Returns a string containing the content of the last assistant message in the conversation, or an empty string if no assistant message is found.
