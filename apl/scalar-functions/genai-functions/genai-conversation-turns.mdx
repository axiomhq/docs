description: 'This page explains how to use the genai_conversation_turns function in APL.'
---

The `genai_conversation_turns` function counts the number of conversation turns in a GenAI messages array. A turn typically represents a user message followed by an assistant response. This metric helps you understand conversation length and engagement patterns in AI applications.

You can use this function to analyze conversation complexity, monitor user engagement, identify outlier conversations, or track conversation metrics for billing and usage analysis.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, you would typically use `eval` with `mvcount` to count array elements, but there’s no built-in function specifically for counting conversation turns.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| eval turn_count=mvcount(messages)/2
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['ai-logs']
| extend turn_count = genai_conversation_turns(messages)
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, you would need to unnest the array and count rows, then divide by the number of roles, which is more complex.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT 
  conversation_id,
  COUNT(*) / 2 as turn_count
FROM conversations
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(messages)
GROUP BY conversation_id
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['ai-logs']
| extend turn_count = genai_conversation_turns(messages)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
genai_conversation_turns(messages)
```

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| messages | dynamic | Yes | An array of message objects from a GenAI conversation. Each message typically contains a `role` and `content` field. |

### Returns

Returns a long integer representing the number of conversation turns. A turn is typically counted as a user-assistant exchange pair.

## Use case examples

Track conversation length across different API endpoints to understand user engagement and conversation complexity.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where uri contains '/api/chat'
| extend turns = genai_conversation_turns(todynamic(response_body)['messages'])
| summarize avg_turns = avg(turns), max_turns = max(turns) by uri
```

**Output**

| uri | avg_turns | max_turns |
|-----|-----------|-----------|
| /api/chat/support | 3.5 | 12 |
| /api/chat/sales | 2.1 | 8 |

This query calculates the average and maximum number of conversation turns for different chat endpoints, helping you understand which services have longer conversations.

<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

Monitor conversation complexity across different AI services in your distributed system.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']

**Output**

| service.name | avg_conversation_turns | percentile_conversation_turns_95 |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| frontend | 4.2 | 9 |

This query helps you understand typical conversation patterns in your AI services and identify outliers.
