description: 'This page explains how to use the week_of_year function in APL.'
---

Use the `week_of_year` function in APL to extract the ISO 8601 week number from a datetime expression. The ISO 8601 standard defines the first week of the year as the one that contains the first Thursday of the year, and weeks start on Mondays.

You can use `week_of_year` to group records by week when analyzing trends over time. This is especially useful for weekly aggregation in dashboards, anomaly detection, and cohort analysis.

Use it when you want to:

- Track activity or metrics week by week.
- Normalize data across different timeframes by weekly intervals.
- Generate week-based summaries across log, trace, or security datasets.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, you typically use the `strftime` function with the `%V` or `%U` specifiers to extract the week of the year. In APL, the `week_of_year` function directly extracts the ISO 8601 week number from a datetime.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
... | eval week=strftime(_time, "%V")
````

```kusto APL equivalent
... | extend week = week_of_year(_time)
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, you often use `EXTRACT(WEEK FROM timestamp)` or `DATEPART(WEEK, timestamp)`. These implementations may differ slightly across platforms in how they define the first week of the year. APL uses the ISO 8601 definition via `week_of_year`.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT EXTRACT(WEEK FROM timestamp_column) AS week FROM events;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['dataset'] 
| extend week = week_of_year(_time)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
week_of_year(datetime)
```

### Parameters

| Name     | Type       | Description               |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| datetime | `datetime` | The input datetime value. |

### Returns

A `long` representing the ISO 8601 week number (from 1 to 53).

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

Group HTTP log events by week to understand traffic trends and average request duration.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend week = week_of_year(_time)
| summarize avg(req_duration_ms) by week
| sort by week asc
```

**Output**

| week | avg_req_duration_ms |
| ---- | ---------------------- |
| 1    | 243.8                  |
| 2    | 251.1                  |
| 3    | 237.4                  |

This query extracts the ISO week number for each record and calculates the average request duration per week.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

Use weekly grouping to monitor changes in span durations for frontend services over time.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| where ['service.name'] == 'frontend'
| extend week = week_of_year(_time)
| summarize avg_duration = avg(duration) by week
| sort by week asc
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20where%20%5B'service.name'%5D%20%3D%3D%20'frontend'%20%7C%20extend%20week%20%3D%20week_of_year(_time)%20%7C%20summarize%20avg_duration%20%3D%20avg(duration)%20by%20week%20%7C%20sort%20by%20week%20asc%22%7D)

**Output**

| week | avg_duration    |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| 1    | 00:00:01.2340000 |
| 2    | 00:00:01.1750000 |
| 3    | 00:00:01.2890000 |

This query shows how the average span duration changes weekly for the `frontend` service.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

Count HTTP errors by week to detect unusual spikes in failed requests.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where status startswith '5'
| extend week = week_of_year(_time)
| summarize error_count = count() by week
| sort by week asc
```
