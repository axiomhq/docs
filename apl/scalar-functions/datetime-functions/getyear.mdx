description: 'This page explains how to use the getyear function in APL.'
---

Use the `getyear` function in APL to extract the year part from a datetime value. The function returns an integer representing the calendar year.

You can use `getyear` to group records by year when analyzing multi-year trends, comparing annual performance, or building year-level summaries. This is useful for dashboards, long-term reporting, and historical analysis.

Use it when you want to:

- Aggregate events by year for trend analysis.
- Compare metrics across years to detect growth or decline.
- Create year-level summaries across log, trace, or security datasets.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, you typically use the `strftime` function with the `%Y` specifier to extract the four-digit year. In APL, the `getyear` function directly returns the year as an integer.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
... | eval year=strftime(_time, "%Y")
```

```kusto APL equivalent
... | extend year = getyear(_time)
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, you use `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp)` or the `YEAR()` function to get the year. In APL, `getyear` provides the same result.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp_column) AS year FROM events;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['dataset']
| extend year = getyear(_time)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

Count HTTP requests by year to understand long-term traffic trends.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend year = getyear(_time)
| summarize request_count = count() by year
| sort by year asc
```

**Output**

| year | request_count |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 2024 | 52340         |
| 2025 | 61892         |

This query groups HTTP log entries by year and counts the total requests per year.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

Compare trace volume across years by service to track annual growth in observability data.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| extend year = getyear(_time)
| summarize trace_count = count() by year, ['service.name']
| sort by year asc
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20extend%20year%20%3D%20getyear(_time)%20%7C%20summarize%20trace_count%20%3D%20count()%20by%20year%2C%20%5B'service.name'%5D%20%7C%20sort%20by%20year%20asc%22%7D)

**Output**

| year | service.name | trace_count |
| ---- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 2024 | frontend     | 12450       |
| 2024 | cart         | 5320        |
| 2025 | frontend     | 14780       |

This query counts traces per service per year, showing how trace volume changes annually for each service.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

Track yearly error trends to identify whether error rates increase or decrease over time.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where toint(status) >= 400
| extend year = getyear(_time)
| summarize error_count = count() by year
| sort by year asc
```

**Output**

| year | error_count |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 2024 | 1245        |
| 2025 | 1587        |

This query filters for HTTP errors (status 400 and above) and counts them per year to reveal annual error trends.
