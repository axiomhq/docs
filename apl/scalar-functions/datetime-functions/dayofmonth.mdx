description: 'This page explains how to use the dayofmonth function in APL.'
---

Use the `dayofmonth` function in APL to extract the day number of the month from a datetime value. The function returns an integer from 1 to 31 representing the day within the month.

You can use `dayofmonth` to analyze patterns tied to specific days of the month, such as billing cycles, payroll processing windows, or recurring scheduled events.

Use it when you want to:

- Detect traffic or error patterns that repeat on specific days of the month.
- Group events by day of month for monthly trend analysis.
- Correlate activity spikes with known monthly schedules such as billing or report generation.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, you typically use `strftime(_time, "%d")` to extract the day of the month. In APL, the `dayofmonth` function directly returns the day number as an integer.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
... | eval day=strftime(_time, "%d")
````

```kusto APL equivalent
... | extend day = dayofmonth(_time)
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, you typically use `EXTRACT(DAY FROM timestamp_column)` or `DAY(timestamp_column)` to get the day of the month. In APL, `dayofmonth` provides the same result with a single function call.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM timestamp_column) AS day FROM events;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['dataset']
| extend day = dayofmonth(_time)
```

</CodeGroup>

### Syntax

```kusto
dayofmonth(datetime)
```

### Parameters

| Name     | Type       | Description               |

## Use case examples

Count requests by day of month to find recurring traffic patterns.

**Query**

```kusto

<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

Find average span duration by day of month for each service.

**Query**

```kusto

| 1   | cart              | 00:00:00.4500000 |
| 2   | frontend          | 00:00:01.2500000 |

This query shows how average span duration varies by day of the month for each service, useful for detecting performance changes tied to monthly cycles.

<Tab title="Security logs">

Identify which days of the month have the most failed requests.

**Query**

```kusto
