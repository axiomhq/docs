description: 'This page explains how to use the dayofweek function in APL.'
---

Use the `dayofweek` function in APL to extract the day of the week from a datetime value as an integer. The function returns the number of days since the preceding Sunday, where 0 represents Sunday, 1 represents Monday, and so on up to 6 for Saturday.

You can use `dayofweek` to group and analyze records by the day of the week. This is especially useful for identifying weekday versus weekend patterns, scheduling-based filtering, and understanding cyclical behavior in your data.

Use it when you want to:

- Group events by day of the week to spot recurring patterns.
- Compare weekday and weekend activity in logs, traces, or security data.
- Filter records to specific days for schedule-based analysis.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, you typically use the `strftime` function with the `%w` specifier to extract the day of the week as an integer (0=Sunday). In APL, the `dayofweek` function returns the same convention directly from a datetime value.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
... | eval day=strftime(_time, "%w")
````

```kusto APL equivalent
... | extend day = dayofweek(_time)
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, you often use `EXTRACT(DOW FROM timestamp)` or `DAYOFWEEK(timestamp)`. The exact numbering convention varies across platforms. APL's `dayofweek` returns 0 for Sunday through 6 for Saturday.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT EXTRACT(DOW FROM timestamp_column) AS day FROM events;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['dataset']
| extend day = dayofweek(_time)
```

</CodeGroup>
