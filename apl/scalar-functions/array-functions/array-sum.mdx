---

The `array_sum` function in APL computes the sum of all numerical elements in an array. This function is particularly useful when you want to aggregate numerical values stored in an array field, such as durations, counts, or measurements, across events or records. Use `array_sum` when your dataset includes array-type fields, and you need to quickly compute their total.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, you might need to use commands or functions such as `mvsum` for similar operations. In APL, `array_sum` provides a direct method to compute the sum of numerical arrays.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| eval total_duration = mvsum(duration_array)
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['dataset.name']
| extend total_duration = array_sum(duration_array)
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

ANSI SQL does not natively support array operations like summing array elements. However, you can achieve similar results with `UNNEST` and `SUM`. In APL, `array_sum` simplifies this by handling array summation directly.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT SUM(value) AS total_duration
FROM UNNEST(duration_array) AS value;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['dataset.name']
| extend total_duration = array_sum(duration_array)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
array_sum(array_expression)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter           | Type     | Description                                     |
|---------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `array_expression`  | array    | An array of numerical values to be summed.     |

### Returns

The function returns the sum of all numerical values in the array. If the array is empty or contains no numerical values, the result is `null`.

## Use case example

Summing the duration of all events in an array field.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize event_duration = make_list(duration) by ['service.name']
| extend total_event_duration = array_sum(event_duration)
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20event_duration%20%3D%20make_list(duration)%20by%20%5B'service.name'%5D%20%7C%20extend%20total_event_duration%20%3D%20array_sum(event_duration)%22%7D)

**Output**

| service.name          | total_event_duration |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| frontend              | 1667269530000                 |
| checkoutservice       | 3801404276900                 |

The query calculates the total duration of all events for each service.
