The `pack_array` function in APL creates an array from individual values or expressions. You can use this function to group related data into a single field, which can simplify handling and querying of data collections. It’s especially useful when working with nested data structures or aggregating data into arrays for further processing.

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

In Splunk SPL, you typically use functions like `mvappend` to create multi-value fields. In APL, the `pack_array` function serves a similar purpose by combining values into an array.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| eval array_field = mvappend(value1, value2, value3)
```

```kusto APL equivalent
| extend array_field = pack_array(value1, value2, value3)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, arrays are often constructed using functions like `ARRAY`. The `pack_array` function in APL performs a similar operation, creating an array from specified values.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT ARRAY[value1, value2, value3] AS array_field;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
| extend array_field = pack_array(value1, value2, value3)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
pack_array(value1, value2, ..., valueN)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| `value1`  | The first value to include in the array. |
| `value2`  | The second value to include in the array. |
| `...`     | Additional values to include in the array. |
| `valueN`  | The last value to include in the array.    |

<Note>
The wildcard `*` in `pack_array(*)` is useful to pack all values from the current row into an array, but it increases query complexity and decreases stability and performance.

`pack_array(*)` packs only the values, not the field names. For key-value pairs, use `bag_pack(*)` instead.
</Note>

### Returns

An array containing the specified values in the order they are provided.

## Use case example

Use `pack_array` to consolidate span data into an array for a trace summary.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| extend span_summary = pack_array(['service.name'], kind, duration)
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20extend%20span_summary%20%3D%20pack_array(%5B'service.name'%5D%2C%20kind%2C%20duration)%22%7D)

**Output**

| service.name      | kind     | duration | span_summary                        |
|-------------------|----------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| frontend          | server   | 123ms    | ["frontend", "server", "123ms"]    |

This query creates a concise representation of span details.
