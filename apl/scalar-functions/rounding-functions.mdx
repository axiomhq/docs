Use rounding functions to adjust numeric values to specific boundaries or intervals. These functions are essential for data binning, time-series aggregation, and converting continuous values to discrete buckets.

## List of functions

| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [ceiling](/apl/scalar-functions/rounding-functions/ceiling) | Rounds a number up to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the input. |
| [bin](/apl/scalar-functions/rounding-functions/bin) | Rounds values down to an integer multiple of a specified bin size. |
| [bin_auto](/apl/scalar-functions/rounding-functions/bin-auto) | Rounds datetime values down to a fixed-size bin with automatic size selection. |
| [floor](/apl/scalar-functions/rounding-functions/floor) | Rounds a number down to the largest integer less than or equal to the input. |
