## dynamic_to_json()

Converts a scalar value of type `dynamic` to a canonical `string` representation.

### Arguments

- dynamic input (EXpr): The function accepts one argument.

### Returns

Returns a canonical representation of the input as a value of type `string`, according to the following rules:

- If the input is a scalar value of type other than `dynamic`, the output is the app of `tostring()` to that value.

- If the input in an array of values, the output is composed of the characters **[, ,, and ]** interspersed with the canonical representation described here of each array element.

- If the input is a property bag, the output is composed of the characters **\{, ,, and \}** interspersed with the colon (:)-delimited name/value pairs of the properties. The pairs are sorted by the names, and the values are in the canonical representation described here of each array element.

### Examples

```kusto
dynamic_to_json(dynamic)
```

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| project conversion_function = dynamic_to_json(dynamic([1,2,3]))
```

- Result:

```json
{
  "conversion_function": "[1,2,3]"
}
```
