---

Use the `toarray` function in APL to convert a dynamic-typed input—such as a bag, property bag, or JSON array—into a regular array. This is helpful when you want to process the elements individually with array functions like `array_length`, `array_index_of`, or `mv-expand`.

You typically use `toarray` when working with semi-structured data, especially after parsing JSON from log fields or external sources. It lets you access and manipulate nested collections using standard array operations.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk, multivalue fields are native, and many SPL commands like `mvexpand`, `mvindex`, and `mvcount` operate directly on them. In APL, dynamic fields can also contain multivalue data, but you need to explicitly convert them to arrays using `toarray` before applying array functions.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
... | eval methods=split("GET,POST,PUT", ",") | mvcount(methods)
````

```kusto APL equivalent
print methods = dynamic(["GET", "POST", "PUT"])
| extend method_count = array_length(toarray(methods))
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

ANSI SQL does not support arrays natively. You typically store lists as JSON and use JSON functions to manipulate them. In APL, you can parse JSON into dynamic values and use `toarray` to convert those into arrays for further processing.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT JSON_ARRAY_LENGTH('["GET","POST","PUT"]')
```

```kusto APL equivalent
print methods = dynamic(["GET", "POST", "PUT"])
| extend method_count = array_length(toarray(methods))
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
toarray(value)
```

### Parameters

| Name  | Type    | Description                              |
| ----- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| value | dynamic | A JSON array, property bag, or bag value |

### Returns

An array containing the elements of the dynamic input. If the input is already an array, the result is identical. If the input is a property bag, it returns an array of values. If the input is not coercible to an array, the result is an empty array.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

You want to analyze what HTTP methods users used in recent requests. The method field sometimes stores multiple methods in a JSON array string.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend methods = toarray(parse_json('["GET", "POST", "PUT"]'))
| project _time, methods
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20extend%20methods%20%3D%20toarray(parse_json('%5B'GET'%2C%20'POST'%2C%20'PUT'%5D'))%20%7C%20project%20_time%2C%20methods%22%7D)

**Output**

| _time | methods |
| ------- | ------- |
| Jun 24, 09:28:10     | ["GET", "POST", "PUT"]    |
| Jun 24, 09:28:10    | ["GET", "POST", "PUT"]    |
| Jun 24, 09:28:10     | ["GET", "POST", "PUT"]     |

This query shows how often each HTTP method occurs across requests that store them as a JSON array string.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

You want to extract and analyze services involved in traces, where `service.name` is embedded in a JSON array in a custom field.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| where _time > ago(1h)
| extend service_list = toarray(parse_json('["frontend", "cartservice", "checkoutservice"]'))
| mv-expand service_list
| summarize span_count = count() by service_list
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20where%20_time%20%3E%20ago%281h%29%20%7C%20extend%20service_list%20%3D%20toarray%28parse_json%28'['frontend'%2C%20'cartservice'%2C%20'checkoutservice']'%29%29%20%7C%20mv-expand%20service_list%20%7C%20summarize%20span_count%20%3D%20count%28%29%20by%20service_list%22%7D)

**Output**

| service_list   | span_count |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| frontend        | 540         |
| cartservice     | 422         |
| checkoutservice | 319         |

This query expands a JSON array of services and counts their usage across traces.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

You want to analyze the number of user actions by grouping over URIs extracted from a nested list stored as JSON in the `uri` field.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where _time > ago(2d)
| extend uri_array = toarray(parse_json('["/login", "/checkout", "/cart"]'))
| mv-expand uri_array
| summarize hits = count() by uri_array
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20where%20_time%20%3E%20ago%282d%29%20%7C%20extend%20uri_array%20%3D%20toarray%28parse_json%28'['/login'%2C%20'/checkout'%2C%20'/cart']'%29%29%20%7C%20mv-expand%20uri_array%20%7C%20summarize%20hits%20%3D%20count%28%29%20by%20uri_array%22%7D)

**Output**

| uri_array | hits |
| ---------- | ---- |
| /login     | 1840 |
| /checkout  | 920  |
| /cart      | 702  |

This example demonstrates how to analyze access patterns when URIs are embedded in array-formatted fields.

## List of related functions

- [array_length](/apl/scalar-functions/array-functions/array-length): Returns the number of elements in an array. Useful before applying `array_extract`.
- [array_index_of](/apl/scalar-functions/array-functions/array-index-of): Finds the position of an element in an array, which can help set the `startIndex` for `array_extract`.
- [pack_array](/apl/scalar-functions/array-functions/pack-array): Use this to combine scalar values into an array. Use `pack_array` when you don’t need named keys and want positional data instead.
- [bag_keys](/apl/scalar-functions/array-functions/bag-keys): Returns the list of keys in a dynamic dictionary. Use this to inspect or filter contents created by `pack_dictionary`.
- [bag_pack](/apl/scalar-functions/array-functions/bag-pack): Expands a dictionary into multiple columns. Use it to revert the packing performed by `pack_dictionary`.
