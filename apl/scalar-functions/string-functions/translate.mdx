---

Use the `translate` function in APL (Axiom Processing Language) to replace characters in a string based on positionally matched characters in a source and destination set. This function is useful when you want to substitute or clean character data in a fast, character-by-character manner.

You can use `translate` when:
- You want to mask or obfuscate sensitive characters.
- You need to normalize strings (for example, convert accented characters to ASCII).
- You want to perform lightweight character-level replacements without regular expressions.

Unlike regular expression-based functions, `translate` is optimized for fixed one-to-one character mapping and doesn’t support pattern matching.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, the `replace` or `gsub` functions are typically used for pattern-based substitutions. However, when you want to do character-for-character replacements, SPL requires multiple `replace()` calls or `eval` expressions.

APL’s `translate` function offers a concise way to perform one-to-one character mappings directly.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
... | eval masked_id=replace(id, "[abc]", "x")
````

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| extend masked_id = translate(id, 'abc', 'xxx')
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, character-level translation is usually done using the `TRANSLATE` function, which behaves similarly to APL’s `translate`. The functionality is almost equivalent, making the transition straightforward.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT TRANSLATE(id, 'abc', 'xyz') FROM sample_http_logs;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| extend new_id = translate(id, 'abc', 'xyz')
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
translate(source, from, to)
```

### Parameters

| Name     | Type     | Description                                                            |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source` | `string` | The input string to transform.                                         |
| `from`   | `string` | A string of characters to be replaced.                                 |
| `to`     | `string` | A string of replacement characters. Must be the same length as `from`. |

### Returns

A `string` where each character in `from` is replaced by the corresponding character in `to`. If `from` contains a character not present in `to`, that character is removed.
