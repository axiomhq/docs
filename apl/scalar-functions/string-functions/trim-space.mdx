description: 'This page explains how to use the trim_space function in APL.'
---

Use the `trim_space` function in APL to remove leading and trailing whitespace characters from a string. This function is especially useful when cleaning up input from logs, APIs, or user-generated content where strings may contain unintended spaces. You can apply `trim_space` to normalize data before comparisons, joins, or aggregations that depend on exact string matches.

Use `trim_space` when you need to ensure that extraneous spaces at the beginning or end of a string don’t interfere with your analysis or results.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk, the `trim` function removes leading and trailing spaces. APL’s `trim_space` works similarly.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| eval cleaned_field = trim(uri)
````

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| extend cleaned_uri = trim_space(uri)
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, the `TRIM()` function removes leading and trailing whitespace by default. APL’s `trim_space` achieves the same behavior.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT TRIM(uri) AS cleaned_uri FROM sample_http_logs
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| extend cleaned_uri = trim_space(uri)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
trim_space(value)
```

### Parameters

| Name  | Type   | Description               |
| ----- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| value | string | The input string to trim. |

### Returns

A string with all leading and trailing whitespace removed. The function does not modify internal whitespace.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

When analyzing request URIs from logs, trailing or leading spaces can lead to false negatives in equality comparisons. Use `trim_space` to normalize request paths.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend cleaned_uri = trim_space(uri)
| summarize count() by cleaned_uri
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20extend%20cleaned_uri%20%3D%20trim_space(uri)%20%7C%20summarize%20count()%20by%20cleaned_uri%22%7D)

**Output**

| cleaned_uri     | count |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| /api/data        | 120   |
| /api/data/submit | 88    |
| /login           | 42    |

This query removes leading and trailing spaces from each `uri` and aggregates request counts by the cleaned path.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

In OpenTelemetry traces, service names or span IDs can have unintended spaces when injected from external tools. Use `trim_space` to standardize span IDs before filtering.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| extend clean_span_id = trim_space(span_id)
| summarize count() by clean_span_id
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20extend%20clean_span_id%20%3D%20trim_space(span_id)%20%7C%20summarize%20count()%20by%20clean_span_id%22%7D)

**Output**

| clean_span_id  | count |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| 53c9e2f4e8794a6a | 17    |
| a3ff4f1e5b9d1c22 | 14    |
| 12c4b9f7da984dc7 | 21    |

This query trims each `span_id` and aggregates span counts, ensuring ID formatting does not affect grouping.
