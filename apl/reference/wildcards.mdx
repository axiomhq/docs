Wildcards in APL allow you to use pattern matching to select multiple datasets or fields without explicitly listing each one. The asterisk (`*`) is the wildcard character that matches zero or more characters.

<Warning>
Wildcards can make queries significantly slower and more expensive, especially when matching many datasets or fields. Use wildcards sparingly and prefer explicit names when possible.
</Warning>

## Dataset wildcards

### Union operator

The `union` operator supports wildcards to combine multiple datasets that match a pattern.

#### Match all datasets

Use `union *` to combine all datasets in your organization:

```kusto
union *
| summarize count() by dataset
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?qid=Eo9iXJT63Kl-t5ifcb&relative=1)

#### Suffix wildcard

Use a suffix wildcard pattern like `github*` to match all datasets that start with "github":

```kusto
union withsource=dataset github*
| summarize count() by dataset
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?qid=N2Is0LGymzX-t5igki&relative=1)

This matches datasets such as:
- `github-push-event`
- `github-pull-request-event`
- `github-issues-event`
- `github-issue-comment-event`

#### Common use case

Count events across all GitHub-related datasets:

```kusto
union withsource=dataset github*
| summarize count() by dataset
```

**Output**

| dataset | count_ |
|---------|--------|
| github-push-event | 1523 |
| github-pull-request-event | 892 |
| github-issues-event | 445 |

### Search operator

The `search` operator supports wildcards in dataset names when using the `in` clause:

```kusto
search in (github*) "error"
```

This searches for the term "error" across all datasets matching the `github*` pattern.

## Field wildcards

### Pack functions

#### bag_pack and pack

Use `bag_pack(*)` or `pack(*)` to pack all fields from the current row into a dynamic property bag:

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| project _time, all_fields = bag_pack(*)
```

This creates a property bag containing all fields from each row. For example:

| _time | all_fields |
|-------|------------|
| 2024-10-17T12:34:56Z | `{ "status": "200", "method": "GET", "uri": "/api/data", ... }` |

#### pack_array

Use `pack_array(*)` to pack all fields from the current row into an array:

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| extend all_values = pack_array(*)
```

<Note>
The `pack_array(*)` wildcard packs all field values into an array, but does not include field names. Use `bag_pack(*)` if you need key-value pairs.
</Note>

### Aggregation functions

#### spotlight

The `spotlight` aggregation function supports wildcards in field parameters to analyze all fields:

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize spotlight(status startswith "5", *)
```

This compares error responses (status codes starting with "5") against the baseline across all fields in the dataset.

#### arg_min and arg_max

Use `*` as a field parameter in `arg_min` and `arg_max` to return all fields from the row with the minimum or maximum value:

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize arg_min(req_duration_ms, *)
```

This returns all fields from the row with the minimum `req_duration_ms` value.

Similarly for `arg_max`:

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize arg_max(req_duration_ms, *)
```

### Project operators

Wildcards are also supported in project-related operators for field selection:

#### project-away

Use wildcards to exclude multiple fields matching a pattern:

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| project-away status*, user*, ['geo.']*
```

This removes all fields starting with `status`, `user`, or `geo.`.

#### project-reorder

Use wildcards to reorder fields:

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| project-reorder method, status, *
```

This places `method` and `status` first, followed by all other fields in their original order.

## Search predicate wildcards

The `search` operator uses wildcards within search predicates to match text patterns. The placement of the asterisk determines the matching behavior:

| Pattern | Operator | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `axiom` | `has` | Matches the term "axiom" |
| `*axiom` | `hassuffix` | Matches text ending with "axiom" |
| `axiom*` | `hasprefix` | Matches text starting with "axiom" |
| `*axiom*` | `contains` | Matches text containing "axiom" |
| `ax*ig` | `matches regex` | Matches text matching the regex pattern |

For more details, see the [search operator documentation](/apl/tabular-operators/search-operator).

## Performance considerations

<Warning>
Wildcards can significantly impact query performance:

- **Dataset wildcards** (`union *`): Querying all datasets is extremely expensive and should be avoided in production. Use specific dataset names or prefix patterns when possible.
- **Field wildcards**: Packing all fields or analyzing all fields can increase memory usage and query time, especially with wide datasets.
- **Search wildcards**: Pattern matching in search predicates is generally efficient, but complex patterns may be slower than exact matches.

Always prefer explicit names over wildcards when performance is critical.
</Warning>

## Examples

### Combine multiple related datasets

Query all GitHub event datasets and count events by type:

```kusto
union withsource=source github*
| extend event_type = case(
    source contains "push", "push",
    source contains "pull", "pull_request",
    source contains "issue", "issue",
    "other"
)
| summarize count() by event_type
```

### Pack all fields for export

Create a single field containing all data for each row:

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where status == '500'
| project _time, error_data = bag_pack(*)
```

### Find minimum with all context

Get the row with the shortest request duration, including all fields:

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize arg_min(req_duration_ms, *)
```

### Analyze all fields with spotlight

Compare error responses to normal traffic across all fields:

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where _time >= now(-15m)
| summarize spotlight(status startswith "5", *)
```
