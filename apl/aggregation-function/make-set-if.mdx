---

The `make_set_if` aggregation function in APL allows you to create a set of distinct values from a column based on a condition. You can use this function to aggregate values that meet specific criteria, helping you filter and reduce data to unique entries while applying a conditional filter. This is especially useful when analyzing large datasets to extract relevant, distinct information without duplicates.

You can use `make_set_if` in scenarios where you need to aggregate conditional data points, such as log analysis, tracing information, or security logs, to summarize distinct occurrences based on particular conditions.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, you may use `values` with a `where` condition to achieve similar functionality to `make_set_if`. However, in APL, the `make_set_if` function is explicitly designed to create a distinct set of values based on a conditional filter within the aggregation step itself.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| stats values(field) by another_field where condition
```

```kusto APL equivalent
summarize make_set_if(field, condition) by another_field
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, you would typically use `GROUP BY` in combination with conditional aggregation, such as using `CASE WHEN` inside aggregate functions. In APL, the `make_set_if` function directly aggregates distinct values conditionally without requiring a `CASE WHEN`.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT DISTINCT CASE WHEN condition THEN field END
FROM table
GROUP BY another_field
```

```kusto APL equivalent
summarize make_set_if(field, condition) by another_field
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
make_set_if(column, predicate, [max_size])
```

### Parameters

- `column`: The column from which distinct values will be aggregated.
- `predicate`: A condition that filters the values to be aggregated.
- `[max_size]`: (Optional) Specifies the maximum number of elements in the resulting set. If omitted, the default is 1048576.

### Returns

The `make_set_if` function returns a dynamic array of distinct values from the specified column that satisfy the given condition.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In this use case, you’re analyzing HTTP logs and want to get the distinct cities from which requests originated, but only for requests that took longer than 500 ms.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize make_set_if(['geo.city'], req_duration_ms > 500) by ['method']
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20make_set_if%28%5B%27geo.city%27%5D%2C%20req_duration_ms%20%3E%20500%29%20by%20%5B%27method%27%5D%22%7D)

**Output**

| method   | make_set_if_geo.city |
|----------|----------------------|
| GET      | [‘New York’, ‘San Francisco’] |
| POST     | [‘Berlin’, ‘Tokyo’]           |

This query returns the distinct cities from which requests took more than 500 ms, grouped by HTTP request method.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

Here, you’re analyzing OpenTelemetry traces and want to identify the distinct services that processed spans with a duration greater than 1 second, grouped by trace ID.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize make_set_if(['service.name'], duration > 1s) by ['trace_id']
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27otel-demo-traces%27%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20make_set_if%28%5B%27service.name%27%5D%2C%20duration%20%3E%201s%29%20by%20%5B%27trace_id%27%5D%22%7D)

**Output**

| trace_id       | make_set_if_service.name |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| abc123         | [‘frontend’, ‘cartservice’] |
| def456         | [‘checkoutservice’, ‘loadgenerator’] |

This query extracts distinct services that have processed spans longer than 1 second for each trace.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In security log analysis, you may want to find out which HTTP status codes were encountered for each city, but only for POST requests.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize make_set_if(status, method == 'POST') by ['geo.city']
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20make_set_if%28status%2C%20method%20%3D%3D%20%27POST%27%29%20by%20%5B%27geo.city%27%5D%22%7D)

**Output**

| geo.city    | make_set_if_status |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Berlin      | [‘200’, ‘404’]     |
| Tokyo       | [‘500’, ‘403’]     |

This query identifies the distinct HTTP status codes for POST requests grouped by the originating city.

## List of related aggregations

- [**make_list_if**](/apl/aggregation-function/make-list-if): Similar to `make_set_if`, but returns a list that can include duplicates instead of a distinct set.
- [**make_set**](/apl/aggregation-function/make-set): Aggregates distinct values without a conditional filter.
- [**countif**](/apl/aggregation-function/countif): Counts rows that satisfy a specific condition, useful for when you need to count rather than aggregate distinct values.
