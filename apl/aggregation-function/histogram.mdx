---

The `histogram` aggregation in APL allows you to create a histogram that groups numeric values into intervals or "bins." This is useful for visualizing the distribution of data, such as the frequency of response times, request durations, or other continuous numerical fields. You can use it to analyze patterns and trends in datasets like logs, traces, or metrics. It's especially helpful when you need to summarize a large volume of data into a digestible form, providing insights on the distribution of values.

The `histogram` aggregation is ideal for identifying peaks, valleys, and outliers in your data. For example, you can analyze the distribution of request durations in web server logs or span durations in OpenTelemetry traces to understand performance bottlenecks.

<Note>
The `histogram` aggregation in APL is a statistical aggregation that returns estimated results. The estimation comes with the benefit of speed at the expense of accuracy. This means that `histogram` is fast and light on resources even on a large or high-cardinality dataset, but it doesn't provide precise results.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, a similar operation to APL's `histogram` is the `timechart` or `histogram` command, which groups events into time buckets. However, in APL, the `histogram` function focuses on numeric values, allowing you to control the number of bins precisely.

<CodeGroup>

```splunk Splunk example
| stats count by duration | timechart span=10 count
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize count() by histogram(req_duration_ms, 10)
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, you can use the `GROUP BY` clause combined with range calculations to achieve a similar result to APL's `histogram`. However, APL's `histogram` function simplifies the process by automatically calculating bin intervals.

<CodeGroup>

```sql SQL example
SELECT COUNT(*), FLOOR(req_duration_ms/10)*10 as duration_bin
FROM sample_http_logs
GROUP BY duration_bin
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize count() by histogram(req_duration_ms, 10)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
histogram(numeric_field, number_of_bins)
```

### Parameters

- `numeric_field`: The numeric field to create a histogram for. For example, request duration or span duration.
- `number_of_bins`: The number of bins (intervals) to use for grouping the numeric values.

### Returns

The `histogram` aggregation returns a table where each row represents a bin, along with the number of occurrences (counts) that fall within each bin.

## Understand histogram results

### Bucket boundaries

The `histogram` function divides the range of your data into equal-width bins. Axiom calculates the bin width as follows:

`bin_width = (max_value - min_value) / number_of_bins`

Each bin value in the results (the `_bin` column) represents the **start** of the bin range. For example, if `histogram(req_duration_ms, 10)` produces bins `0`, `100`, `200`, this means:
- The first bin covers values from `0` (inclusive) to `100` (exclusive): `[0, 100)`
- The second bin covers values from `100` (inclusive) to `200` (exclusive): `[100, 200)`
- The last bin covers values from `200` (inclusive) to the maximum value (inclusive): `[200, max]`

### The `number_of_bins` parameter

The `number_of_bins` parameter specifies the number of bins, not the bin width. Axiom determines the bin width automatically based on the range of values in your data.

For example, if your data ranges from `0` to `1000` and you specify `histogram(field, 10)`, each bin is approximately `100` wide. If you specify `histogram(field, 100)`, each bin is approximately `10` wide.

<Note>
Because `histogram` returns estimated results, the actual number of bins in the output might differ slightly from the specified `number_of_bins`.
</Note>

### Visualize with heatmaps

When you combine `histogram` with `bin_auto(_time)`, the results can be visualized as a [heatmap](/dashboard-elements/heatmap). The histogram bins appear on the Y-axis, time intervals on the X-axis, and the color intensity represents the count of events in each cell.

## Use case examples

- [**percentile**](/apl/aggregation-function/percentile): Use `percentile` when you need to find the specific value below which a percentage of observations fall, which can provide more precise distribution analysis.
- [**avg**](/apl/aggregation-function/avg): Use `avg` for calculating the average value of a numeric field, useful when you are more interested in the central tendency rather than distribution.
- [**sum**](/apl/aggregation-function/sum): The `sum` function adds up the total values in a numeric field, helpful for determining overall totals.
- [**count**](/apl/aggregation-function/count): Use `count` when you need a simple tally of rows or events, often in conjunction with `histogram` for more basic summarization.
