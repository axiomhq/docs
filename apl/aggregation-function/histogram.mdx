---

The `histogram` aggregation in APL allows you to create a histogram that groups numeric values into intervals or "bins." This is useful for visualizing the distribution of data, such as the frequency of response times, request durations, or other continuous numerical fields. You can use it to analyze patterns and trends in datasets like logs, traces, or metrics. It is especially helpful when you need to summarize a large volume of data into a digestible form, providing insights on the distribution of values.

The `histogram` aggregation is ideal for identifying peaks, valleys, and outliers in your data. For example, you can analyze the distribution of request durations in web server logs or span durations in OpenTelemetry traces to understand performance bottlenecks.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, a similar operation to APL's `histogram` is the `timechart` or `histogram` command, which groups events into time buckets. However, in APL, the `histogram` function focuses on numeric values, allowing you to control the bin size and boundaries more precisely.

<CodeGroup>

```splunk Splunk example
| stats count by duration | timechart span=10 count
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize count() by histogram(req_duration_ms, 10)
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, you can use the `GROUP BY` clause combined with range calculations to achieve a similar result to APL’s `histogram`. However, APL’s `histogram` function simplifies the process by automatically calculating bin intervals.

<CodeGroup>

```sql SQL example
SELECT COUNT(*), FLOOR(req_duration_ms/10)*10 as duration_bin
FROM sample_http_logs
GROUP BY duration_bin
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize count() by histogram(req_duration_ms, 10)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
histogram(numeric_field, bin_size)
```

### Parameters

- `numeric_field`: The numeric field you want to create a histogram for. This can be a field like request duration or span duration.
- `bin_size`: The size of each bin, or interval, into which the numeric values will be grouped.

### Returns

The `histogram` aggregation returns a table where each row represents a bin, along with the number of occurrences (counts) that fall within each bin.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

You can use the `histogram` aggregation to analyze the distribution of request durations in web server logs.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize histogram(req_duration_ms, 100) by bin_auto(_time)
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20histogram(req_duration_ms%2C%20100)%20by%20bin_auto(_time)%22%7D)

**Output**

| req_duration_ms_bin | count |
|---------------------|-------|
| 0                   | 50    |
| 100                 | 200   |
| 200                 | 120   |

This query creates a histogram that groups request durations into bins of 100 milliseconds and shows the count of requests in each bin. It helps you visualize how frequently requests fall within certain duration ranges.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

In OpenTelemetry traces, you can use the `histogram` aggregation to analyze the distribution of span durations.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize histogram(duration, 100) by bin_auto(_time)
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20histogram(duration%2C%20100)%20by%20bin_auto(_time)%22%7D)

**Output**

| duration_bin | count |
|--------------|-------|
| 0.1s         | 30    |
| 0.2s         | 120   |
| 0.3s         | 50    |

This query groups the span durations into 100ms intervals, making it easier to spot latency issues in your traces.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In security logs, the `histogram` aggregation helps you understand the frequency distribution of request durations to detect anomalies or attacks.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where status == '200'
| summarize histogram(req_duration_ms, 50) by bin_auto(_time)
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20where%20status%20%3D%3D%20'200'%20%7C%20summarize%20histogram(req_duration_ms%2C%2050)%20by%20bin_auto(_time)%22%7D)

**Output**

| req_duration_ms_bin | count |
|---------------------|-------|
| 0                   | 150    |
| 50                  | 400    |
| 100                 | 100    |

This query analyzes the request durations for HTTP 200 (Success) responses, helping you identify patterns in security-related events.

## List of related aggregations

- [**percentile**](/apl/aggregation-function/percentile): Use `percentile` when you need to find the specific value below which a percentage of observations fall, which can provide more precise distribution analysis.
- [**avg**](/apl/aggregation-function/avg): Use `avg` for calculating the average value of a numeric field, useful when you are more interested in the central tendency rather than distribution.
- [**sum**](/apl/aggregation-function/sum): The `sum` function adds up the total values in a numeric field, helpful for determining overall totals.
- [**count**](/apl/aggregation-function/count): Use `count` when you need a simple tally of rows or events, often in conjunction with `histogram` for more basic summarization.
