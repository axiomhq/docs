---

The `make_list` aggregation function in Axiom Processing Language (APL) collects all values from a specified column into a dynamic array for each group of rows in a dataset. This aggregation is particularly useful when you want to consolidate multiple values from distinct rows into a single grouped result. 

For example, if you have multiple log entries for a particular user, you can use `make_list` to gather all request URIs accessed by that user into a single list. You can also apply `make_list` to various contexts, such as trace aggregation, log analysis, or security monitoring, where collating related events into a compact form is needed.

Key uses of `make_list`:

- Consolidating values from multiple rows into a list per group.
- Summarizing activity (e.g., list all HTTP requests by a user).
- Generating traces or timelines from distributed logs.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, the `make_list` equivalent is `values()` or `mvlist()`, which gathers multiple values into a multivalue field. In APL, `make_list` behaves similarly by collecting values from rows into a dynamic array.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
index=logs | stats values(uri) by user
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize uris=make_list(uri) by id
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, the `make_list` function is similar to `ARRAY_AGG()`, which aggregates column values into an array for each group. In APL, `make_list` performs the same role, grouping the column values into a dynamic array.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT ARRAY_AGG(uri) AS uris FROM sample_http_logs GROUP BY id;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize uris=make_list(uri) by id
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
make_list(column)
```

### Parameters

- `column`: The name of the column to collect into a list.

### Returns

The `make_list` function returns a dynamic array that contains all values of the specified column for each group of rows.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In log analysis, `make_list` is useful for collecting all URIs a user has accessed in a session. This can help in identifying browsing patterns or tracking user activity.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize uris=make_list(uri) by id
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20uris%3Dmake_list%28uri%29%20by%20id%22%7D)

**Output**

| id       | uris                             |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| user123  | [‘/home’, ‘/profile’, ‘/cart’]   |
| user456  | [‘/search’, ‘/checkout’, ‘/pay’] |

This query collects all URIs accessed by each user, providing a compact view of user activity in the logs.

</Tab>

<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

In OpenTelemetry traces, `make_list` can help in gathering the list of services involved in a trace by consolidating all service names related to a trace ID.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize services=make_list(['service.name']) by trace_id
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27otel-demo-traces%27%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20services%3Dmake_list%28%5B%27service.name%27%5D%29%20by%20trace_id%22%7D)

**Output**

| trace_id          | services                                       |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| trace_a           | [‘frontend’, ‘cartservice’, ‘checkoutservice’]  |
| trace_b           | [‘productcatalogservice’, ‘loadgenerator’]      |

This query aggregates all service names associated with a particular trace, helping trace spans across different services.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Security logs">

In security logs, `make_list` is useful for collecting all IPs or cities from where a user has initiated requests, aiding in detecting anomalies or patterns.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize cities=make_list(['geo.city']) by id
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20cities%3Dmake_list%28%5B%27geo.city%27%5D%29%20by%20id%22%7D)

**Output**

| id       | cities                         |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| user123  | [‘New York’, ‘Los Angeles’]     |
| user456  | [‘Berlin’, ‘London’]            |

This query collects the cities from which each user has made HTTP requests, useful for geographical analysis or anomaly detection.

## List of related aggregations

- [`make_set`](/apl/aggregation-function/make_set): Similar to `make_list`, but only unique values are collected in the set. Use `make_set` when duplicates aren’t relevant.
- [`count`](/apl/aggregation-function/count): Returns the count of rows in each group. Use this instead of `make_list` when you're interested in row totals rather than individual values.
- [`max`](/apl/aggregation-function/max): Aggregates values by returning the maximum value from each group. Useful for numeric comparison across rows.
- [`dcount`](/apl/aggregation-function/dcount): Returns the distinct count of values for each group. Use this when you need unique value counts instead of listing them.
