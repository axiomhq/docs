description: 'This page explains how to use the phrases aggregation function in APL.'
---

The `phrases` aggregation extracts and counts common phrases or word sequences from text fields across a dataset. It analyzes text content to identify frequently occurring phrases, helping you discover patterns, trends, and common topics in your data.

You can use this aggregation to identify common user queries, discover trending topics, extract key phrases from logs, or analyze conversation patterns in AI applications.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, thereâ€™s no built-in phrases function, but you might use the `rare` or `top` commands on tokenized text.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| rex field=message "(?<words>\w+)"
| top words
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize phrases(uri, 10)
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, you would need complex string manipulation and grouping to extract common phrases.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT 
  phrase,
  COUNT(*) as frequency
FROM (
  SELECT UNNEST(SPLIT(message, ' ')) as phrase
  FROM logs
)
GROUP BY phrase
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 10
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize phrases(uri, 10)
```
</CodeGroup>

- [make_list](/apl/aggregation-function/make-list): Creates an array of all values. Use this when you need all occurrences rather than common phrases.
- [make_set](/apl/aggregation-function/make-set): Creates an array of unique values. Use this for distinct values without frequency analysis.
- [topk](/apl/aggregation-function/topk): Returns top K values by a specific aggregation. Use this for numerical top values rather than phrase extraction.
- [count](/apl/aggregation-function/count): Counts occurrences. Combine with group by for manual phrase counting if you need more control.
- [dcount](/apl/aggregation-function/dcount): Counts distinct values. Use this to understand the variety of phrases before extracting top ones.
