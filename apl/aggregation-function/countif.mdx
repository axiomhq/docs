---

The `countif` aggregation function in Axiom Processing Language (APL) counts the number of records that meet a specified condition. You can use this aggregation to filter records based on a specific condition and return a count of matching records. This is particularly useful for log analysis, security audits, and tracing events when you need to isolate and count specific data subsets.

Use `countif` when you want to count occurrences of certain conditions, such as HTTP status codes, errors, or actions in telemetry traces.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, conditional counting is typically done using the `eval` function combined with `stats`. APL provides a more streamlined approach with the `countif` function, which performs conditional counting directly.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| stats count(eval(status="500")) AS error_count
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize countif(status == '500')
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, conditional counting is achieved by using the `COUNT` function with a `CASE` statement. In APL, `countif` simplifies this process by offering a direct approach to conditional counting.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN status = '500' THEN 1 END) AS error_count
FROM sample_http_logs
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize countif(status == '500')
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
countif(condition)
```

### Parameters

- **condition**: A boolean expression that filters the records based on a condition. Only records where the condition evaluates to `true` are counted.

### Returns

The function returns the number of records that match the specified condition.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Log analysis">

In log analysis, you might want to count how many HTTP requests returned a 500 status code to detect server errors.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize countif(status == '500')
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20countif(status%20%3D%3D%20'500')%22%7D)

**Output**

| count_errors |
|--------------|
| 72           |

This query counts the number of HTTP requests with a `500` status, helping you identify how many server errors occurred.

</Tab>

<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

In OpenTelemetry traces, you might want to count how many requests were initiated by the client service kind.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize countif(kind == 'client')
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20countif(kind%20%3D%3D%20'client')%22%7D)

**Output**

| count_client_kind |
|-------------------|
| 345               |

This query counts how many requests were initiated by the `client` service kind, providing insight into the volume of client-side traffic.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Security logs">

In security logs, you might want to count how many HTTP requests originated from a specific city, such as New York.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize countif(['geo.city'] == 'New York')
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20countif(%5B'geo.city'%5D%20%3D%3D%20'New%20York')%22%7D)

**Output**

| count_nyc_requests |
|--------------------|
| 87                 |

This query counts how many HTTP requests originated from New York, which can help detect traffic from a particular location for security analysis.

## List of related aggregations

- [`count`](/apl/aggregation-function/count): Counts all records in a dataset without applying a condition. Use this when you need the total count of records, regardless of any specific condition.
- [`sumif`](/apl/aggregation-function/sumif): Adds up the values of a field for records that meet a specific condition. Use `sumif` when you want to sum values based on a filter.
- [`dcountif`](/apl/aggregation-function/dcountif): Counts distinct values of a field for records that meet a condition. This is helpful when you need to count unique occurrences.
- [`avgif`](/apl/aggregation-function/avgif): Calculates the average value of a field for records that match a condition, useful for performance monitoring.
- [`maxif`](/apl/aggregation-function/maxif): Returns the maximum value of a field for records that meet a condition. Use this when you want to find the highest value in filtered data.
