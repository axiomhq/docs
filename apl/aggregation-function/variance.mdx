---

The `variance` aggregation function in APL calculates the variance of a numeric expression across a set of records. Variance is a statistical measurement that represents the spread of data points in a dataset. It's useful for understanding how much variation exists in your data. In scenarios such as performance analysis, network traffic monitoring, or anomaly detection, `variance` helps identify outliers and patterns by showing how data points deviate from the mean.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In SPL, variance is computed using the `stats` command with the `var` function, whereas in APL, you can use `variance` for the same functionality.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| stats var(req_duration_ms) as variance
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs'] 
| summarize variance(req_duration_ms)
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, variance is typically calculated using `VAR_POP` or `VAR_SAMP`. APL provides a simpler approach using the `variance` function without needing to specify population or sample.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT VAR_POP(req_duration_ms) FROM sample_http_logs;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs'] 
| summarize variance(req_duration_ms)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
summarize variance(Expression)
```

### Parameters

- `Expression`: A numeric expression or field for which you want to compute the variance. The expression should evaluate to a numeric data type.

### Returns

The function returns the variance (a numeric value) of the specified expression across the records.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

You can use the `variance` function to measure the variability of request durations, which helps in identifying performance bottlenecks or anomalies in web services.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs'] 
| summarize variance(req_duration_ms)
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20variance(req_duration_ms)%22%7D)

**Output**

| variance_req_duration_ms |
|--------------------------|
| 1024.5                   |

This query calculates the variance of request durations from a dataset of HTTP logs. A high variance indicates greater variability in request durations, potentially signaling performance issues.

</Tab>

<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

For OpenTelemetry traces, `variance` can be used to measure how much span durations differ across service invocations, helping in performance optimization and anomaly detection.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces'] 
| summarize variance(duration)
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20variance(duration)%22%7D)

**Output**

| variance_duration |
|-------------------|
| 1287.3            |

This query computes the variance of span durations across traces, which helps in understanding how consistent the service performance is. A higher variance might indicate unstable or inconsistent performance.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Security logs">

You can use the `variance` function on security logs to detect abnormal patterns in request behavior, such as unusual fluctuations in response times, which may point to potential security threats.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs'] 
| summarize variance(req_duration_ms) by status
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20variance(req_duration_ms)%20by%20status%22%7D)

**Output**

| status | variance_req_duration_ms |
|--------|--------------------------|
| 200    | 1534.8                   |
| 404    | 2103.4                   |

This query calculates the variance of request durations grouped by HTTP status codes. High variance in certain status codes (e.g., 404 errors) can indicate network or application issues.

## List of related aggregations

- [**stdev**](/apl/aggregation-function/stdev): Computes the standard deviation, which is the square root of the variance. Use `stdev` when you need the spread of data in the same units as the original dataset.
- [**avg**](/apl/aggregation-function/avg): Computes the average of a numeric field. Combine `avg` with `variance` to analyze both the central tendency and the spread of data.
- [**count**](/apl/aggregation-function/count): Counts the number of records. Use `count` alongside `variance` to get a sense of data size relative to variance.
- [**percentile**](/apl/aggregation-function/percentile): Returns a value below which a given percentage of observations fall. Use `percentile` for a more detailed distribution analysis.
- [**max**](/apl/aggregation-function/max): Returns the maximum value. Use `max` when you are looking for extreme values in addition to variance to detect anomalies.
