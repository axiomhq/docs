description: 'This page explains how to use the arg_min aggregation in APL.'
---

The `arg_min` aggregation in APL allows you to identify the row in a dataset where an expression evaluates to the minimum value. You can use this to retrieve other associated fields in the same row, making it particularly useful for pinpointing details about the smallest value in large datasets. If you group your data, `arg_min` finds the row within each group where a particular expression evaluates to the minimum value.

This aggregation is particularly useful in scenarios like the following:

- Pinpoint the shortest HTTP requests in log data and retrieve associated details (like URL, status code, and user agent) for the same row.
- Identify the fastest span durations in OpenTelemetry traces with additional context (like span name, trace ID, and attributes) for the same row.
- Highlight the lowest severity security alerts in logs along with relevant metadata (such as alert type, source, and timestamp) for the same row.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

Splunk SPL doesnâ€™t have an equivalent to `arg_min`. You can use `stats` with a combination of `values` and `first` clauses to evaluate the minimum value of a single numberic field. APL provides a dedicated `arg_min` aggregation that evaluates expressions.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| stats min(req_duration_ms) as minDuration by id
| where req_duration_ms=minDuration
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize arg_min(req_duration_ms, id, uri)
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, achieving similar functionality often requires a combination of `MIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `JOIN` to retrieve the associated fields. APL's `arg_min` eliminates the need for multiple steps by directly returning the row with the minimum value.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT id, uri
FROM sample_http_logs
WHERE req_duration_ms = (
    SELECT MIN(req_duration_ms)
    FROM sample_http_logs
);
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize arg_min(req_duration_ms, id, uri)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
| summarize arg_min(expression, field1, ..., fieldN)
```

### Parameters

- `expression`: The expression to evaluate for the minimum value.
- `field1, ..., fieldN`: Additional fields to return from the row with the minimum value.

### Returns

Returns a row where the expression evaluates to the minimum value for each group (or the entire dataset if no grouping is specified), containing the fields specified in the query.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

You can use `arg_min` to identify the path with the shortest duration and its associated details for each method.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize arg_min(req_duration_ms, uri) by method
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20arg_min(req_duration_ms%2C%20uri)%20by%20method%22%7D)

**Output**

| req_duration_ms | uri                | method |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------|
| 0.1              | /api/login         | POST   |

This query identifies the paths with the shortest duration for each method and provides details about the path.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

Use `arg_min` to find the span with the shortest duration for each service and retrieve its associated details.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize arg_min(duration, trace_id, span_id, kind) by ['service.name']
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20arg_min(duration%2C%20trace_id%2C%20span_id%2C%20kind)%20by%20%5B'service.name'%5D%22%7D)

**Output**

| duration | trace_id   | span_id    | service.name       | kind     |
|----------|------------|------------|--------------------|----------|
| 00:00:01 | abc123     | span456    | frontend           | server   |

This query identifies the span with the shortest duration for each service along with its metadata.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

Find the lowest status code for each country in the `['sample-http-logs']` dataset.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize arg_min(toint(status), uri) by ['geo.country']
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20arg_min(toint(status)%2C%20uri)%20by%20%5B'geo.country'%5D%22%7D)

**Output**

| geo.country  | uri               | status |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| USA          | /admin            | 200    |
| Canada       | /dashboard        | 201    |

This query identifies the URI with the lowest status code for each country.
