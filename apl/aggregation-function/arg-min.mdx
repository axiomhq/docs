---

The `arg_min` aggregation in APL allows you to identify the row in a dataset where a specific numeric field has the minimum value. You can use this to retrieve other associated fields in the same row, making it particularly useful for pinpointing details about the smallest value in large datasets. Typical use cases include identifying the shortest request duration in web logs, the fastest span duration in OpenTelemetry traces, or the lowest security risk score in logs.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, achieving similar functionality involves using the `stats` command with the `values` or `first` functions after sorting by the desired field. In APL, `arg_min` simplifies this by directly providing the row with the minimum value for a given field.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| stats min(req_duration_ms) as minDuration by id
| where req_duration_ms=minDuration
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize arg_min(req_duration_ms, id, uri)
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, achieving similar functionality often requires a combination of `MIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `JOIN` to retrieve the associated fields. APL's `arg_min` eliminates the need for multiple steps by directly returning the row with the minimum value.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT id, uri
FROM sample_http_logs
WHERE req_duration_ms = (
    SELECT MIN(req_duration_ms)
    FROM sample_http_logs
);
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize arg_min(req_duration_ms, id, uri)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
| summarize arg_min(numeric_field, field1, ..., fieldN)
```

### Parameters

- `numeric_field`: The numeric field to evaluate for the minimum value.
- `field1, ..., fieldN`: Additional fields to return from the row with the minimum value.

### Returns

A single row containing the minimum value of the numeric field and the corresponding values of the specified additional fields.

## Use case examples

You can use `arg_min` to identify the HTTP request with the shortest duration and its associated details.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize arg_min(req_duration_ms, uri, method)
```

**Output**

| req_duration_ms | uri                | method |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------|
| 12              | /api/login         | POST   |

This query identifies the shortest HTTP request duration and provides details about the request.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

Use `arg_min` to find the span with the shortest duration and retrieve its associated details.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize arg_min(duration, trace_id, span_id, ['service.name'], kind)
```

**Output**

| duration | trace_id   | span_id    | service.name       | kind     |
|----------|------------|------------|--------------------|----------|
| 00:00:01 | abc123     | span456    | frontend           | server   |

This query identifies the span with the shortest duration along with its metadata.

Find the lowest status code for each country in the `['sample-http-logs']` dataset.

**Query**

```kusto
