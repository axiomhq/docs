description: 'This page explains how to use the stdev aggregation function in APL.'
---

The `stdev` aggregation in APL computes the standard deviation of a numeric field within a dataset. This is useful for understanding the variability or dispersion of data points around the mean. You can apply this aggregation to various use cases, such as performance monitoring, anomaly detection, and statistical analysis of logs and traces.

Use the `stdev` function to determine how spread out values like request duration, span duration, or response times are. This is particularly helpful when analyzing data trends and identifying inconsistencies, outliers, or abnormal behavior.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, the `stdev` aggregation function works similarly but has a different syntax. While SPL uses the `stdev` command within the `stats` function, APL users will find the aggregation works similarly in APL with just minor differences in syntax.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| stats stdev(duration) as duration_std
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['dataset']
| summarize duration_std = stdev(duration)
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, the standard deviation is computed using the `STDDEV` function. APL's `stdev` function is the direct equivalent of SQLâ€™s `STDDEV`, although APL uses pipes (`|`) for chaining operations and different keyword formatting.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT STDDEV(duration) AS duration_std FROM dataset;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['dataset']
| summarize duration_std = stdev(duration)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
stdev(numeric_field)
```

### Parameters

- **`numeric_field`**: The field containing numeric values for which the standard deviation is calculated.

### Returns

The `stdev` aggregation returns a single numeric value representing the standard deviation of the specified numeric field in the dataset.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

You can use the `stdev` aggregation to analyze HTTP request durations and identify performance variations across different requests. For instance, you can calculate the standard deviation of request durations to identify potential anomalies.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize req_duration_std = stdev(req_duration_ms)
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20req_duration_std%20%3D%20stdev(req_duration_ms)%22%7D)

**Output**

| req_duration_std |
|------------------|
| 345.67           |

This query calculates the standard deviation of the `req_duration_ms` field in the `sample-http-logs` dataset, helping to understand how much variability there is in request durations.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

In distributed tracing, calculating the standard deviation of span durations can help identify inconsistent spans that might indicate performance issues or bottlenecks.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize span_duration_std = stdev(duration)
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20span_duration_std%20%3D%20stdev(duration)%22%7D)

**Output**

| span_duration_std |
|-------------------|
| 0:00:02.456       |

This query computes the standard deviation of span durations in the `otel-demo-traces` dataset, providing insight into how much variation exists between trace spans.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In security logs, the `stdev` function can help analyze the response times of various HTTP requests, potentially identifying patterns that might be related to security incidents or abnormal behavior.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize resp_time_std = stdev(req_duration_ms) by status
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20resp_time_std%20%3D%20stdev(req_duration_ms)%20by%20status%22%7D)

**Output**

| status | resp_time_std |
|--------|---------------|
| 200    | 123.45        |
| 500    | 567.89        |

This query calculates the standard deviation of request durations grouped by the HTTP status code, providing insight into the performance of different status codes.

- **`avg`**: Calculates the average value of a numeric field. Use `avg` to understand the central tendency of the data.
- **`min`**: Returns the smallest value in a numeric field. Use `min` when you need to find the minimum value.
- **`max`**: Returns the largest value in a numeric field. Use `max` to identify the peak value in a dataset.
- **`sum`**: Adds up all the values in a numeric field. Use `sum` to get a total across records.
- **`count`**: Returns the number of records in a dataset. Use `count` when you need the number of occurrences or entries.
