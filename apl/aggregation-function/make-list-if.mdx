---

The `make_list_if` aggregation function in APL creates a list of values from a given field, conditioned on a Boolean expression. This function is useful when you need to gather values from a column that meet specific criteria into a single array. By using `make_list_if`, you can aggregate data based on dynamic conditions, making it easier to perform detailed analysis.

This aggregation is ideal in scenarios where filtering at the aggregation level is required, such as gathering only successful requests, collecting trace spans of a specific service in OpenTelemetry data, or analyzing logs. It's particularly useful when analyzing logs, tracing information, or security events, where conditional aggregation is essential for understanding trends or identifying issues.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk, you would typically use the `eval` and `stats` commands to create conditional lists. In APL, the `make_list_if` function serves a similar purpose by allowing you to aggregate data into a list based on a condition.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| stats list(field) as field_list by condition
```

```kusto APL equivalent
summarize make_list_if(field, condition)
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, conditional aggregation often involves using `CASE` statements combined with aggregation functions such as `ARRAY_AGG`. In APL, `make_list_if` directly applies a condition to the aggregation.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT ARRAY_AGG(CASE WHEN condition THEN field END) FROM table
```

```kusto APL equivalent
summarize make_list_if(field, condition)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
summarize make_list_if(expression, condition)
```

### Parameters

- `expression`: The field or expression whose values will be included in the list.
- `condition`: A Boolean condition that determines which values from `expression` are included in the result.

### Returns

The function returns an array containing all values from `expression` that meet the specified `condition`.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In this example, we gather a list of request durations for successful HTTP requests.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize make_list_if(req_duration_ms, status == '200') by id
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D+%7C+summarize+make_list_if%28req_duration_ms%2C+status+%3D%3D+%27200%27%29+by+id%22%7D)

**Output**

| id  | req_duration_ms_list          |
|-----|-------------------------------|
| 123 | [100, 150, 200]               |
| 456 | [300, 350, 400]               |

This query aggregates request durations for HTTP requests that returned a status of '200' for each user ID.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

Here, we aggregate the span durations for `cartservice` where the status code indicates success.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize make_list_if(duration, status_code == '200' and ['service.name'] == 'cartservice') by trace_id
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27otel-demo-traces%27%5D+%7C+summarize+make_list_if%28duration%2C+status_code+%3D%3D+%27200%27+and+%5B%27service.name%27%5D+%3D%3D+%27cartservice%27%29+by+trace_id%22%7D)

**Output**

| trace_id | duration_list             |
|----------|---------------------------|
| abc123   | [00:01:23, 00:01:45]      |
| def456   | [00:02:12, 00:03:15]      |

This query collects span durations for successful requests to the `cartservice` by `trace_id`.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In this case, we gather a list of IP addresses from security logs where the HTTP status is `403` (Forbidden) and group them by the country of origin.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize make_list_if(uri, status == '403') by ['geo.country']
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D+%7C+summarize+make_list_if%28uri%2C+status+%3D%3D+%27403%27%29+by+%5B%27geo.country%27%5D%22%7D)

**Output**

| geo.country | uri_list                 |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| USA         | ['/login', '/admin']     |
| Canada      | ['/admin', '/secure']    |

This query collects a list of URIs that resulted in a `403` error, grouped by the country where the request originated.

## List of related aggregations

- [**make_list**](/apl/aggregation-function/make-list): Aggregates all values into a list without any conditions. Use `make_list` when you don't need to filter the values based on a condition.
- [**countif**](/apl/aggregation-function/countif): Counts the number of records that satisfy a specific condition. Use `countif` when you need a count of occurrences rather than a list of values.
- [**avgif**](/apl/aggregation-function/avgif): Calculates the average of values that meet a specified condition. Use `avgif` for numerical aggregations where you want a conditional average instead of a list.
