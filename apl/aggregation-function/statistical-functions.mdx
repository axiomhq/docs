The table summarizes the aggregation functions available in APL. Use all these aggregation functions in the context of the [summarize operator](/apl/tabular-operators/summarize-operator).

| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [avg](/apl/aggregation-function/avg) | Average value across the group. |
| [avgif](/apl/aggregation-function/avgif) | Average value of an expression in records where the predicate is true. |
| [count](/apl/aggregation-function/count) | Count of the group with or without a predicate. |
| [countif](/apl/aggregation-function/countif) | Count of rows where the predicate is true. |
| [dcount](/apl/aggregation-function/dcount) | Estimated number of distinct values for an expression in the summary group. |
| [dcountif](/apl/aggregation-function/dcountif) | Estimated number of distinct values of an expression where the predicate is true. |
| [histogram](/apl/aggregation-function/histogram) | Timeseries heatmap chart across the group. |
| [make_list](/apl/aggregation-function/make-list) | Dynamic JSON array of all expression values in the group. |
| [make_list_if](/apl/aggregation-function/make-list-if) | Dynamic JSON array of expression values where the predicate is true. |
| [make_set](/apl/aggregation-function/make-set) | Dynamic JSON array of distinct expression values in the group. |
| [make_set_if](/apl/aggregation-function/make-set-if) | Dynamic JSON array of distinct expression values where the predicate is true. |
| [max](/apl/aggregation-function/max) | Maximum value across the group. |
| [maxif](/apl/aggregation-function/maxif) | Maximum value of an expression where the predicate is true. |
| [min](/apl/aggregation-function/min) | Minimum value across the group. |
| [minif](/apl/aggregation-function/minif) | Minimum value of an expression where the predicate is true. |
| [percentile](/apl/aggregation-function/percentile) | Requested percentiles of the group with a timeseries chart. |
| [rate](/apl/aggregation-function/rate) | Rate of values in a group per second. |
| [stdev](/apl/aggregation-function/stdev) | Standard deviation of an expression across the group. |
| [stdevif](/apl/aggregation-function/stdevif) | Standard deviation of an expression where the predicate is true. |
| [sum](/apl/aggregation-function/sum) | Sum of an expression across the group. |
| [sumif](/apl/aggregation-function/sumif) | Sum of an expression where the predicate is true. |
| [topk](/apl/aggregation-function/topk) | Calculates the top values of an expression across the group. |
| [variance](/apl/aggregation-function/variance) | Variance of an expression across the group. |
| [varianceif](/apl/aggregation-function/varianceif) | Variance of an expression where the predicate is true. |
