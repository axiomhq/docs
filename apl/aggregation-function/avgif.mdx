---

The `avgif` aggregation function in APL allows you to calculate the average value of a field, but only for records that satisfy a given condition. This function is particularly useful when you need to perform a filtered aggregation, such as finding the average response time for requests that returned a specific status code or filtering by geographic regions. The `avgif` function is highly valuable in scenarios like log analysis, performance monitoring, and anomaly detection, where focusing on subsets of data can provide more accurate insights.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk, you achieve similar functionality using the combination of a `stats` function with conditional filtering. In APL, `avgif` provides this filtering inline as part of the aggregation function, which can simplify your queries.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| stats avg(req_duration_ms) by id where status = "200"
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs'] 
| summarize avgif(req_duration_ms, status == "200") by id
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, you can use a `CASE` statement inside an `AVG()` function to achieve similar behavior. APL simplifies this with `avgif`, allowing you to specify the condition directly.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT id, AVG(CASE WHEN status = '200' THEN req_duration_ms ELSE NULL END) 
FROM sample_http_logs 
GROUP BY id
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs'] 
| summarize avgif(req_duration_ms, status == "200") by id
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
summarize avgif(expr, predicate) by grouping_field
```

### Parameters

- **`expr`**: The field for which you want to calculate the average.
- **`predicate`**: A boolean condition that filters which records are included in the calculation.
- **`grouping_field`**: (Optional) A field by which you want to group the results.

### Returns

The function returns the average of the values from the `expr` field for the records that satisfy the `predicate`. If no records match the condition, the result is `null`.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In this example, you calculate the average request duration for HTTP status 200 in different cities.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs'] 
| summarize avgif(req_duration_ms, status == "200") by ['geo.city']
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20avgif%28req_duration_ms%2C%20status%20%3D%3D%20%22200%22%29%20by%20%5B%27geo.city%27%5D%22%7D)

**Output**

| geo.city   | avg_req_duration_ms |
|------------|---------------------|
| New York   | 325                 |
| London     | 400                 |
| Tokyo      | 275                 |

This query calculates the average request duration (`req_duration_ms`) for HTTP requests that returned a status of 200 (`status == "200"`), grouped by the city where the request originated (`geo.city`).

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

In this example, you calculate the average span duration for traces that ended with HTTP status 500.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces'] 
| summarize avgif(duration, status == "500") by ['service.name']
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27otel-demo-traces%27%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20avgif%28duration%2C%20status%20%3D%3D%20%22500%22%29%20by%20%5B%27service.name%27%5D%22%7D)

**Output**

| service.name          | avg_duration |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| checkoutservice       | 500ms        |
| frontend              | 600ms        |
| cartservice           | 475ms        |

This query calculates the average span duration (`duration`) for traces where the status code is 500 (`status == "500"`), grouped by the service name (`service.name`).

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In this example, you calculate the average request duration for failed HTTP requests (status code 400 or higher) by country.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs'] 
| summarize avgif(req_duration_ms, toint(status) >= 400) by ['geo.country']
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20avgif%28req_duration_ms%2C%20toint%28status%29%20%3E%3D%20400%29%20by%20%5B%27geo.country%27%5D%22%7D)

**Output**

| geo.country   | avg_req_duration_ms |
|---------------|---------------------|
| USA           | 450                 |
| Canada        | 500                 |
| Germany       | 425                 |

This query calculates the average request duration (`req_duration_ms`) for failed HTTP requests (`status >= 400`), grouped by the country of origin (`geo.country`).

- [`minif`](/apl/aggregation-function/minif): Returns the minimum value of an expression, filtered by a predicate. Use when you want to find the smallest value for a subset of data.
- [`maxif`](/apl/aggregation-function/maxif): Returns the maximum value of an expression, filtered by a predicate. Use when you are looking for the largest value within specific conditions.
- [`countif`](/apl/aggregation-function/countif): Counts the number of records that match a condition. Use when you want to know how many records meet a specific criterion.
- [`sumif`](/apl/aggregation-function/sumif): Sums the values of a field that match a given condition. Ideal for calculating the total of a subset of data.
