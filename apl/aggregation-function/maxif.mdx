# maxif aggregation in APL

## Introduction

The `maxif` aggregation function in APL is useful when you want to return the maximum value from a dataset based on a conditional expression. This allows you to filter the dataset dynamically and only return the maximum for rows that satisfy the given condition. It’s particularly helpful for scenarios where you want to find the highest value of a specific metric, like response time or duration, but only for a subset of the data (e.g., successful responses, specific users, or requests from a particular geographic location).

You can use the `maxif` function when analyzing logs, monitoring system traces, or inspecting security-related data to get insights into the maximum value under certain conditions.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, you might use the `stats max()` function alongside a conditional filtering step to achieve a similar result. APL’s `maxif` function combines both operations into one, streamlining the query.

<CodeGroup>
```splunk
| stats max(req_duration_ms) as max_duration where status="200"
```

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize maxif(req_duration_ms, status == "200")
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, you typically use the `MAX()` function in conjunction with a `WHERE` clause. APL’s `maxif` allows you to perform the same operation with a single aggregation function.

<CodeGroup>
```sql
SELECT MAX(req_duration_ms) 
FROM logs 
WHERE status = '200';
```

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize maxif(req_duration_ms, status == "200")
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
summarize maxif(column, condition)
```

### Parameters

- `column`: The column containing the values to aggregate.
- `condition`: The condition that must be true for the values to be considered in the aggregation.

### Returns

The maximum value from `column` for rows that meet the `condition`. If no rows match the condition, it returns `null`.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In log analysis, you might want to find the maximum request duration, but only for successful requests.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize maxif(req_duration_ms, status == "200")
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20maxif(req_duration_ms,%20status%20%3D%3D%20'200')%22%7D)

**Output**

| max_req_duration |
|------------------|
| 1250             |

This query returns the maximum request duration (`req_duration_ms`) for HTTP requests with a `200` status.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

In OpenTelemetry traces, you might want to find the longest span duration for a specific service type.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize maxif(duration, ['service.name'] == "checkoutservice" and kind == "server")
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20maxif(duration,%20%5B'service.name'%5D%20%3D%3D%20'checkoutservice'%20and%20kind%20%3D%3D%20'server')%22%7D)

**Output**

| max_duration |
|--------------|
| 2.05s        |

This query returns the maximum span duration (`duration`) for server spans in the `checkoutservice`.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

For security logs, you might want to identify the longest request duration for any requests originating from a specific country, such as the United States.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize maxif(req_duration_ms, ['geo.country'] == "United States")
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20maxif(req_duration_ms,%20%5B'geo.country'%5D%20%3D%3D%20'United%20States')%22%7D)

**Output**

| max_req_duration |
|------------------|
| 980              |

This query returns the maximum request duration for requests coming from the United States (`geo.country`).

- [**minif**](/apl/aggregation-function/minif): Returns the minimum value from a column for rows that satisfy a condition. Use `minif` when you're interested in the lowest value under specific conditions.
- [**max**](/apl/aggregation-function/max): Returns the maximum value from a column without filtering. Use `max()` when you want the highest value across the entire dataset without conditions.
- [**sumif**](/apl/aggregation-function/sumif): Returns the sum of values for rows that satisfy a condition. Use `sumif` when you want the total value of a column under specific conditions.
- [**avgif**](/apl/aggregation-function/avgif): Returns the average of values for rows that satisfy a condition. Use `avgif` when you want to calculate the mean value based on a filter.
- [**countif**](/apl/aggregation-function/countif): Returns the count of rows that satisfy a condition. Use `countif` when you want to count occurrences that meet certain criteria.
