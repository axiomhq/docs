## Introduction

The `minif` aggregation in Axiom Processing Language (APL) allows you to calculate the minimum value of a numeric expression, but only for records that meet a specific condition. This aggregation is useful when you want to find the smallest value in a subset of data that satisfies a given predicate. For example, you can use `minif` to find the shortest request duration for successful HTTP requests, or the minimum span duration for a specific service in your OpenTelemetry traces.

The `minif` aggregation is especially useful in scenarios where you need conditional aggregations, such as log analysis, monitoring distributed systems, or examining security-related events.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk, you might use the `min` function in combination with `where` to filter results. In APL, the `minif` function combines both the filtering condition and the minimum calculation into one step.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| stats min(req_duration_ms) as min_duration where status="200"
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize minif(req_duration_ms, status == "200") by id
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, you would typically use a `CASE` statement with `MIN` to apply conditional logic for aggregation. In APL, the `minif` function simplifies this by combining both the condition and the aggregation.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT MIN(CASE WHEN status = '200' THEN req_duration_ms ELSE NULL END) as min_duration
FROM sample_http_logs
GROUP BY id;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize minif(req_duration_ms, status == "200") by id
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
summarize minif(Expression, Predicate)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter  | Description                                                   |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Expression` | The numeric expression whose minimum value you want to find.   |
| `Predicate`  | The condition that determines which records to include.        |

### Returns

The `minif` aggregation returns the minimum value of the specified `Expression` for the records that satisfy the `Predicate`.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In log analysis, you might want to find the minimum request duration for successful HTTP requests.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize minif(req_duration_ms, status == '200') by ['geo.city']
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20minif(req_duration_ms,%20status%20%3D%3D%20'200')%20by%20%5B'geo.city'%5D%22%7D)

**Output**

| geo.city   | min_duration |
|------------|--------------|
| San Diego  | 120          |
| New York   | 95           |

This query finds the minimum request duration for HTTP requests with a `200` status code, grouped by city.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

For distributed tracing, you can use `minif` to find the minimum span duration for a specific service.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize minif(duration, ['service.name'] == 'frontend') by trace_id
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20minif(duration,%20%5B'service.name'%5D%20%3D%3D%20'frontend')%20by%20trace_id%22%7D)

**Output**

| trace_id   | min_duration  |
|------------|---------------|
| abc123     | 50ms          |
| def456     | 40ms          |

This query returns the minimum span duration for traces from the `frontend` service, grouped by `trace_id`.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In security logs, you can use `minif` to find the minimum request duration for HTTP requests from a specific country.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize minif(req_duration_ms, ['geo.country'] == 'US') by status
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20minif(req_duration_ms,%20%5B'geo.country'%5D%20%3D%3D%20'US')%20by%20status%22%7D)

**Output**

| status   | min_duration |
|----------|--------------|
| 200      | 95           |
| 404      | 120          |

This query returns the minimum request duration for HTTP requests originating from the United States, grouped by HTTP status code.

## List of related aggregations

- [**maxif**](/apl/aggregation-function/maxif): Finds the maximum value of an expression that satisfies a condition. Use `maxif` when you need the maximum value under a condition, rather than the minimum.
- [**avgif**](/apl/aggregation-function/avgif): Calculates the average value of an expression that meets a specified condition. Useful when you want an average instead of a minimum.
- [**countif**](/apl/aggregation-function/countif): Counts the number of records that satisfy a given condition. Use this for counting records rather than calculating a minimum.
- [**sumif**](/apl/aggregation-function/sumif): Sums the values of an expression for records that meet a condition. Helpful when you're interested in the total rather than the minimum.
