description: 'This page explains how to use the percentileif aggregation function in APL.'
---

The `percentileif` aggregation function calculates the percentile of a numeric column, conditional on a specified boolean predicate. This function is useful for filtering data dynamically and determining percentile values based only on relevant subsets of data.

You can use `percentileif` to gain insights in various scenarios, such as:

- Identifying response time percentiles for HTTP requests from specific regions.
- Calculating percentiles of span durations for specific service types in OpenTelemetry traces.
- Analyzing security events by percentile within defined risk categories.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

The `percentileif` aggregation in APL works similarly to `percentile` combined with conditional filtering in SPL. However, APL integrates the condition directly into the aggregation for simplicity.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
stats perc95(req_duration_ms) as p95 where geo.country="US"
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize percentileif(req_duration_ms, 95, geo.country == 'US')
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In SQL, you typically calculate percentiles using window functions or aggregate functions combined with a `WHERE` clause. APL simplifies this by embedding the condition directly in the `percentileif` aggregation.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY req_duration_ms)
FROM sample_http_logs
WHERE geo_country = 'US'
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize percentileif(req_duration_ms, 95, geo.country == 'US')
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
summarize percentileif(NumericColumn, Percentile, Predicate)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NumericColumn` | The numeric column from which to calculate the percentile.                                                   |
| `Percentile`    | A number between 0 and 100 that specifies the percentile to calculate.                                        |
| `Predicate`     | A boolean expression that filters rows to include in the calculation.                                         |

### Returns

The function returns a single numeric value representing the specified percentile of the `NumericColumn` for rows where the `Predicate` evaluates to `true`.

## Use case examples

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

You can use `percentileif` to measure span durations for specific services and operation kinds.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize percentileif(duration, 95, ['service.name'] == 'frontend' and kind == 'server')
```

## List of related aggregations

- **`percentile`**: Calculates the percentile for all rows without any filtering. Use `percentile` when you donâ€™t need conditional filtering.
- **`avgif`**: Calculates the average of a numeric column based on a condition. Use `avgif` for mean calculations instead of percentiles.
- **`minif`**: Returns the minimum value of a numeric column where a condition is true. Use `minif` for identifying the lowest values within subsets.
- **`maxif`**: Returns the maximum value of a numeric column where a condition is true. Use `maxif` for identifying the highest values within subsets.
- **`sumif`**: Sums a numeric column based on a condition. Use `sumif` for conditional total calculations.
