---

Use the `percentiles_array` aggregation function in APL to calculate multiple percentile values over a numeric expression in one pass. This function is useful when you want to understand the distribution of numeric data points, such as response times or durations, by summarizing them at several key percentiles like the 25th, 50th, and 95th.

You can use `percentiles_array` to:

- Analyze latency or duration metrics across requests or operations.
- Identify performance outliers.
- Visualize percentile distributions in dashboards.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk, you typically calculate percentiles one at a time using the `perc` function. To get multiple percentiles, you repeat the function with different percentile values. In APL, `percentiles_array` lets you specify multiple percentiles in a single function call and returns them as an array.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
... | stats perc95(duration), perc50(duration), perc25(duration) by service
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize percentiles_array(duration, 25, 50, 95) by ['service.name']
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

Standard SQL typically lacks a built-in function to calculate multiple percentiles in a single operation. Instead, you use `PERCENTILE_CONT` or `PERCENTILE_DISC` with `WITHIN GROUP`, repeated for each desired percentile. In APL, `percentiles_array` simplifies this with a single function call that returns all requested percentiles as an array.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT
  service,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration) AS p25,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration) AS p50,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration) AS p95
FROM traces
GROUP BY service
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize percentiles_array(duration, 25, 50, 95) by ['service.name']
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
percentiles_array(Expression, Percentile1, Percentile2, ...)
```

### Parameters

| Name        | Type              | Description |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `Expression` | `real` or `long` | The numeric expression to evaluate. |
| `Percentile1`, `Percentile2`, ... | `real` | One or more percentile values between `0` and `100`. |

### Returns

An array of real numbers, where each element is the value at the corresponding percentile.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

Use `percentiles_array` to understand the spread of request durations per HTTP method, highlighting performance variability.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize percentiles_array(req_duration_ms, 25, 50, 95) by method
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D %7C summarize percentiles_array(req_duration_ms%2C 25%2C 50%2C 95) by method%22%7D)

**Output**

| method | percentiles_array_req_duration_ms |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| GET    | [48, 85, 203]                     |
| POST   | [92, 150, 302]                    |

This query calculates the 25th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of request durations for each HTTP method. It helps identify performance differences between GET and POST requests.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

Use `percentiles_array` to analyze the distribution of span durations by service to detect potential bottlenecks.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize percentiles_array(duration, 50, 90, 99) by ['service.name']
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27otel-demo-traces%27%5D %7C summarize percentiles_array(duration%2C 50%2C 90%2C 99) by %5B%27service.name%27%5D%22%7D)

**Output**

| service.name         | percentiles_array_duration |
|----------------------|----------------------------|
| frontend             | [85ms, 140ms, 305ms]        |
| checkoutservice      | [110ms, 210ms, 450ms]       |

This query shows latency patterns across services by computing the median, 90th, and 99th percentile of span durations.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

Use `percentiles_array` to assess outlier response times per status code, which can reveal abnormal activity or service issues.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize percentiles_array(req_duration_ms, 50, 95, 99) by status
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D %7C summarize percentiles_array(req_duration_ms%2C 50%2C 95%2C 99) by status%22%7D)

**Output**

| status | percentiles_array_req_duration_ms |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| 200    | [90, 200, 300]                    |
| 500    | [180, 450, 700]                   |

This query helps identify whether requests resulting in errors (like 500) are significantly slower than successful ones.
