---

Use the `percentiles_array` aggregation function in APL to calculate multiple percentile values over a numeric expression in one pass. This function is useful when you want to understand the distribution of numeric data points, such as response times or durations, by summarizing them at several key percentiles like the 25th, 50th, and 95th.

You can use `percentiles_array` to:

- Analyze latency or duration metrics across requests or operations.
- Identify performance outliers.
- Visualize percentile distributions in dashboards.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk, you typically calculate percentiles one at a time using the `perc` function. To get multiple percentiles, you repeat the function with different percentile values. In APL, `percentiles_array` lets you specify multiple percentiles in a single function call and returns them as an array.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
... | stats perc95(duration), perc50(duration), perc25(duration) by service
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize percentiles_array(duration, 25, 50, 95) by ['service.name']
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

Standard SQL typically lacks a built-in function to calculate multiple percentiles in a single operation. Instead, you use `PERCENTILE_CONT` or `PERCENTILE_DISC` with `WITHIN GROUP`, repeated for each desired percentile. In APL, `percentiles_array` simplifies this with a single function call that returns all requested percentiles as an array.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT
  service,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration) AS p25,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration) AS p50,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration) AS p95
FROM traces
GROUP BY service
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize percentiles_array(duration, 25, 50, 95) by ['service.name']
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
percentiles_array(Field, Percentile1, Percentile2, ...)
```

### Parameters

- `Field` is the name of the field for which you want to compute percentile values.
- `Percentile1`, `Percentile2`, ... are numeric percentile values between 0 and 100.

### Returns

An array of numbers where each element is the value at the corresponding percentile.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

Use `percentiles_array` to understand the spread of request durations per HTTP method, highlighting performance variability.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize percentiles_array(req_duration_ms, 25, 50, 95) by method
```
