description: 'This page explains how to use the dcountif aggregation function in APL.'
---

The `dcountif` aggregation function in Axiom Processing Language (APL) counts the distinct values in a column that meet a specific condition. This is useful when you want to filter records and count only the unique occurrences that satisfy a given criterion. 

Use `dcountif` in scenarios where you need a distinct count but only for a subset of the data, such as counting unique users from a specific region, unique error codes for specific HTTP statuses, or distinct traces that match a particular service type.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, counting distinct values conditionally is typically achieved using a combination of `eval` and `dc` in the `stats` function. APL simplifies this with the `dcountif` function, which handles both filtering and distinct counting in a single step.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| stats dc(eval(status="200")) AS distinct_successful_users
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize dcountif(id, status == '200')
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, conditional distinct counting can be done using a combination of `COUNT(DISTINCT)` and `CASE`. APL's `dcountif` function provides a more concise and readable way to handle conditional distinct counting.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN status = '200' THEN user_id END) AS distinct_successful_users
FROM sample_http_logs
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize dcountif(id, status == '200')
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
dcountif(column_name, condition)
```

### Parameters

- **column_name**: The name of the column for which you want to count distinct values.
- **condition**: A boolean expression that filters the records. Only records that meet the condition will be included in the distinct count.

### Returns

The function returns the count of distinct values that meet the specified condition.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Log analysis">

In log analysis, you might want to count how many distinct users accessed the service and received a successful response (HTTP status 200).

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize dcountif(id, status == '200')
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20dcountif(id%2C%20status%20%3D%3D%20'200')%22%7D)

**Output**

| distinct_successful_users |
|---------------------------|
| 50                        |

This query counts the distinct users (`id` field) who received a successful HTTP response (status 200), helping you understand how many unique users had successful requests.

</Tab>

<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

In OpenTelemetry traces, you might want to count how many unique trace IDs are recorded for a specific service, such as `frontend`.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize dcountif(trace_id, ['service.name'] == 'frontend')
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20dcountif(trace_id%2C%20%5B'service.name'%5D%20%3D%3D%20'frontend')%22%7D)

**Output**

| distinct_frontend_traces |
|--------------------------|
| 123                      |

This query counts the number of distinct trace IDs that belong to the `frontend` service, providing insight into the volume of unique traces for that service.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Security logs">

In security logs, you might want to count how many unique IP addresses were logged for requests that resulted in a 403 status (forbidden access).

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize dcountif(['geo.city'], status == '403')
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20dcountif(%5B'geo.city'%5D%2C%20status%20%3D%3D%20'403')%22%7D)

**Output**

| distinct_cities_forbidden |
|---------------------------|
| 20                        |

This query counts the number of distinct cities (`geo.city` field) where requests resulted in a `403` status, helping you identify potential unauthorized access attempts from different regions.

- [**dcount**](/apl/aggregation-function/dcount): Counts distinct values without applying any condition. Use this when you need to count unique values across the entire dataset.
- [**countif**](/apl/aggregation-function/countif): Counts records that match a specific condition, without focusing on distinct values. Use this when you need to count records based on a filter.
- [**dcountif**](/apl/aggregation-function/dcountif): Use this function to get a distinct count for records that meet a condition. It combines both filtering and distinct counting.
- [**sumif**](/apl/aggregation-function/sumif): Sums values in a column for records that meet a condition. This is useful when you need to sum data points after filtering.
