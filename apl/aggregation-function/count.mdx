## Introduction

The `count` aggregation function in APL counts the number of rows in a dataset or a subset of a dataset. It’s one of the most basic and frequently used aggregation functions, helping you quickly understand the size of your dataset or how many records match specific criteria.

The `count` function is useful in a wide range of scenarios, such as counting the number of log entries, transactions, events, or security incidents in a given time period. Use it when you need to quantify the occurrence of events or records in your data.

## Related aggregations

The `count` function is often used alongside other aggregation functions. Here’s how it compares:

- **`countif`**: Use when you want to count only the rows that satisfy a certain condition. `count` counts all rows, while `countif` is conditional.
- **`dcount`**: Use this function if you want to count distinct values in a column. `dcount` provides a count of unique items, whereas `count` tallies every row.
- **`sum`**: Use when you want to compute the sum of values in a column rather than counting rows. It’s ideal for aggregating numeric fields.
- **`avg`**: Use when you want to calculate the average of numeric values in a column, whereas `count` simply returns the number of rows.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, the `count` function is equivalent to APL's `count`. It is used in similar contexts to return the number of events or records in a dataset.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
index=web_logs | stats count
```

```kusto APL equivalent
web_logs
| summarize count()
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, the `COUNT()` function is the equivalent of APL’s `count`. Both return the number of rows in the result set.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM web_logs;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
web_logs
| summarize count()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
summarize count()
```

### Parameters

The `count` function takes no parameters. It simply returns the number of rows in the dataset or the grouped subset.

### Returns

The `count` function returns an integer representing the total number of rows in the input dataset or within each group if used with a `by` clause.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In log analysis, you can use the `count` function to determine how many log entries are present within specific time intervals.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize count() by bin(_time, 1m)
```

**Output**

| timestamp           | count |
|---------------------|-------|
| 2024-09-26 10:00:00 | 2345  |
| 2024-09-26 10:01:00 | 1987  |
| 2024-09-26 10:02:00 | 2201  |

This query counts the number of log entries in one-minute intervals.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

In OpenTelemetry trace analysis, you can use `count` to see how many traces occurred over a certain period, helping identify traffic patterns.

**Query**

```kusto
traces
| summarize count() by bin(timestamp, 5m)
```

**Output**

| timestamp           | count |
|---------------------|-------|
| 2024-09-26 10:00:00 | 520   |
| 2024-09-26 10:05:00 | 478   |
| 2024-09-26 10:10:00 | 503   |

This query counts the number of traces generated in five-minute intervals.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

In security monitoring, you can use the `count` function to see how many security events occurred during different time windows.

**Query**

```kusto
security_logs
| summarize count() by bin(timestamp, 1d)
```

**Output**

| timestamp           | count |
|---------------------|-------|
| 2024-09-25 00:00:00 | 85    |
| 2024-09-26 00:00:00 | 92    |
| 2024-09-27 00:00:00 | 103   |

This query counts the number of security events that occurred daily.
