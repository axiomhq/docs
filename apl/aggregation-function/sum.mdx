---

The `sum` aggregation in APL is used to compute the total sum of a specific numeric field in a dataset. This aggregation is useful when you want to find the cumulative value for a certain metric, such as the total duration of requests, total sales revenue, or any other numeric field that can be summed.

You can use the `sum` aggregation in a wide range of scenarios, such as analyzing log data, monitoring traces, or examining security logs. It is particularly helpful when you want to get a quick overview of your data in terms of totals or cumulative statistics.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk, you use the `sum` function in combination with the `stats` command to aggregate data. In APL, the `sum` aggregation works similarly but is structured differently in terms of syntax.

<CodeGroup>
```splunk Splunk example
| stats sum(req_duration_ms) as total_duration
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize total_duration = sum(req_duration_ms)
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, the `SUM` function is commonly used with the `GROUP BY` clause to aggregate data by a specific field. In APL, the `sum` function works similarly but can be used without requiring a `GROUP BY` clause for simple summations.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT SUM(req_duration_ms) AS total_duration
FROM sample_http_logs
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize total_duration = sum(req_duration_ms)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
summarize [<new_column_name> =] sum(<numeric_field>)
```

### Parameters

- `<new_column_name>`: (Optional) The name you want to assign to the resulting column that contains the sum.
- `<numeric_field>`: The field in your dataset that contains the numeric values you want to sum.

### Returns

The `sum` aggregation returns a single row with the sum of the specified numeric field. If used with a `by` clause, it returns multiple rows with the sum per group.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

The `sum` aggregation can be used to calculate the total request duration in an HTTP log dataset.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize total_duration = sum(req_duration_ms)
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20total_duration%20%3D%20sum(req_duration_ms)%22%7D)

**Output**

| total_duration |
|----------------|
| 123456         |

This query calculates the total request duration across all HTTP requests in the dataset.

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

The `sum` aggregation can be applied to OpenTelemetry traces to calculate the total span duration.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize total_duration = sum(duration)
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20total_duration%20%3D%20sum(duration)%22%7D)

**Output**

| total_duration |
|----------------|
| 7890           |

This query calculates the total duration of all spans in the dataset.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

You can use the `sum` aggregation to calculate the total number of requests based on a specific HTTP status in security logs.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| where status == '200'
| summarize request_count = sum(1)
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/explorer?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20where%20status%20%3D%3D%20'200'%20%7C%20summarize%20request_count%20%3D%20sum(1)%22%7D)

**Output**

| request_count |
|---------------|
| 500           |

This query counts the total number of successful requests (status 200) in the dataset.

## List of related aggregations

- [**count**](/apl/aggregation-function/count): Counts the number of records in a dataset. Use `count` when you want to count the number of rows, not aggregate numeric values.
- [**avg**](/apl/aggregation-function/avg): Computes the average value of a numeric field. Use `avg` when you need to find the mean instead of the total sum.
- [**min**](/apl/aggregation-function/min): Returns the minimum value of a numeric field. Use `min` when you're interested in the lowest value.
- [**max**](/apl/aggregation-function/max): Returns the maximum value of a numeric field. Use `max` when you're interested in the highest value.
- [**sumif**](/apl/aggregation-function/sumif): Sums a numeric field conditionally. Use `sumif` when you only want to sum values that meet a specific condition.
