---

The `sumif` aggregation function in Axiom Processing Language (APL) computes the sum of a numeric expression for records that meet a specified condition. This function is useful when you want to filter data based on specific criteria and aggregate the numeric values that match the condition. Use `sumif` when you need to apply conditional logic to sums, such as calculating the total request duration for successful HTTP requests or summing the span durations in OpenTelemetry traces for a specific service.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, the `sumif` equivalent functionality requires using a `stats` command with a `where` clause to filter the data. In APL, you can use `sumif` to simplify this operation by combining both the condition and the summing logic into one function.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Splunk example
| stats sum(duration) as total_duration where status="200"
```

```kusto APL equivalent
summarize total_duration = sumif(duration, status == '200')
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, achieving a similar result typically involves using a `CASE` statement inside the `SUM` function to conditionally sum values based on a specified condition. In APL, `sumif` provides a more concise approach by allowing you to filter and sum in a single function.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN status = '200' THEN duration ELSE 0 END) AS total_duration
FROM http_logs
```

```kusto APL equivalent
summarize total_duration = sumif(duration, status == '200')
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
sumif(numeric_expression, condition)
```

### Parameters

- `numeric_expression`: The numeric field or expression you want to sum.
- `condition`: A boolean expression that determines which records contribute to the sum. Only the records that satisfy the condition are considered.

### Returns

`sumif` returns the sum of the values in `numeric_expression` for records where the `condition` is true. If no records meet the condition, the result is 0.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In this use case, we calculate the total request duration for HTTP requests that returned a `200` status code.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize total_req_duration = sumif(req_duration_ms, status == '200')
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20total_req_duration%20%3D%20sumif%28req_duration_ms%2C%20status%20%3D%3D%20%27200%27%29%22%7D)

**Output**

| total_req_duration |
|--------------------|
| 145000             |

This query computes the total request duration (in milliseconds) for all successful HTTP requests (those with a status code of `200`).

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

In this example, we sum the span durations for the `frontend` service in OpenTelemetry traces.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize total_duration = sumif(duration, ['service.name'] == 'frontend')
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27otel-demo-traces%27%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20total_duration%20%3D%20sumif%28duration%2C%20%5B%27service.name%27%5D%20%3D%3D%20%27frontend%27%29%22%7D)

**Output**

| total_duration |
|----------------|
| 32000          |

This query sums the span durations for traces related to the `frontend` service, providing insight into how long this service has been running over time.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Security logs">

Here, we calculate the total request duration for failed HTTP requests (those with status codes other than `200`).

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize total_req_duration_failed = sumif(req_duration_ms, status != '200')
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B%27sample-http-logs%27%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20total_req_duration_failed%20%3D%20sumif%28req_duration_ms%2C%20status%20%21%3D%20%27200%27%29%22%7D)

**Output**

| total_req_duration_failed |
|---------------------------|
| 64000                     |

This query computes the total request duration for all failed HTTP requests (where the status code is not `200`), which can be useful for security log analysis.

## List of related aggregations

- [**avgif**](/apl/aggregation-function/avgif): Computes the average of a numeric expression for records that meet a specified condition. Use `avgif` when youâ€™re interested in the average value, not the total sum.
- [**countif**](/apl/aggregation-function/countif): Counts the number of records that satisfy a condition. Use `countif` when you need to know how many records match a specific criterion.
- [**minif**](/apl/aggregation-function/minif): Returns the minimum value of a numeric expression for records that meet a condition. Useful when you need the smallest value under certain criteria.
- [**maxif**](/apl/aggregation-function/maxif): Returns the maximum value of a numeric expression for records that meet a condition. Use `maxif` to identify the highest values under certain conditions.
