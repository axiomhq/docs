description: 'This page explains how to use the min aggregation function in APL.'
---

The `min` aggregation function in APL returns the minimum value from a set of input values. You can use this function to identify the smallest numeric or comparable value in a column of data. This is useful when you want to find the quickest response time, the lowest transaction amount, or the earliest date in log data. Itâ€™s ideal for analyzing performance metrics, filtering out abnormal low points in your data, or discovering outliers.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk, the `min` function works similarly to APL's `min` aggregation, allowing you to find the minimum value in a field across your dataset. The main difference is in the query structure and syntax between the two.

<CodeGroup>

```sql Splunk example
| stats min(duration) by id
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize min(req_duration_ms) by id
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, the `MIN` function works almost identically to the APL `min` aggregation. You use it to return the smallest value in a column of data, grouped by one or more fields.

<CodeGroup>

```sql SQL example
SELECT MIN(duration), id FROM sample_http_logs GROUP BY id;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize min(req_duration_ms) by id
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
summarize min(Expression)
```

### Parameters

- `Expression`: The expression from which to calculate the minimum value. Typically, this is a numeric or date/time field.

### Returns

The function returns the smallest value found in the specified column or expression.

## Use case examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Log analysis">

In this use case, you analyze HTTP logs to find the minimum request duration for each unique user.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize min(req_duration_ms) by id
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20min(req_duration_ms)%20by%20id%22%7D)

**Output**

| id         | min_req_duration_ms |
|------------|---------------------|
| user_123   | 32                  |
| user_456   | 45                  |

This query returns the minimum request duration for each user, helping you identify the fastest responses.

</Tab>

<Tab title="OpenTelemetry traces">

Here, you analyze OpenTelemetry trace data to find the minimum span duration per service.

**Query**

```kusto
['otel-demo-traces']
| summarize min(duration) by ['service.name']
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'otel-demo-traces'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20min(duration)%20by%20%5B'service.name'%5D%22%7D)

**Output**

| service.name       | min_duration |
|--------------------|--------------|
| frontend           | 2ms          |
| checkoutservice    | 5ms          |

This query returns the minimum span duration for each service in the trace logs.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Security logs">

In this example, you analyze security logs to find the minimum request duration for each HTTP status code.

**Query**

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize min(req_duration_ms) by status
```

[Run in Playground](https://play.axiom.co/axiom-play-qf1k/query?initForm=%7B%22apl%22%3A%22%5B'sample-http-logs'%5D%20%7C%20summarize%20min(req_duration_ms)%20by%20status%22%7D)

**Output**

| status   | min_req_duration_ms |
|----------|---------------------|
| 200      | 10                  |
| 404      | 40                  |

This query returns the minimum request duration for each HTTP status code, helping you identify if certain statuses are associated with faster or slower response times.

## List of related aggregations

- [**max**](/apl/aggregation-function/max): Returns the maximum value from a set of values. Use `max` when you need to find the highest value instead of the lowest.
- [**avg**](/apl/aggregation-function/avg): Calculates the average of a set of values. Use `avg` to find the mean value instead of the minimum.
- [**count**](/apl/aggregation-function/count): Counts the number of records or distinct values. Use `count` when you need to know how many records or unique values exist, rather than calculating the minimum.
- [**sum**](/apl/aggregation-function/sum): Adds all values together. Use `sum` when you need the total of a set of values rather than the minimum.
- [**percentile**](/apl/aggregation-function/percentile): Returns the value at a specified percentile. Use `percentile` if you need a value that falls at a certain point in the distribution of your data, rather than the minimum.
