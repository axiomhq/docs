---

The `rate` aggregation function in APL (Axiom Processing Language) helps you calculate the rate of change over a specific time interval. This is especially useful for scenarios where you need to monitor how frequently an event occurs or how a value changes over time. For example, you can use the `rate` function to track request rates in web logs or changes in metrics like CPU usage or memory consumption.

The `rate` function is useful for analyzing trends in time series data and identifying unusual spikes or drops in activity. It can help you understand patterns in logs, metrics, and traces over specific intervals, such as per minute, per second, or per hour.

## For users of other query languages

If you come from other query languages, this section explains how to adjust your existing queries to achieve the same results in APL.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Splunk SPL users">

In Splunk SPL, the equivalent of the `rate` function can be achieved using the `timechart` command with a `per_second` option or by calculating the difference between successive values over time. In APL, the `rate` function simplifies this process by directly calculating the rate over a specified time interval.

<CodeGroup>
```splunk Splunk example
| timechart per_second count by resp_body_size_bytes
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize rate(resp_body_size_bytes) by bin(_time, 1s)
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ANSI SQL users">

In ANSI SQL, calculating rates typically involves using window functions like `LAG` or `LEAD` to calculate the difference between successive rows in a time series. In APL, the `rate` function abstracts this complexity by allowing you to directly compute the rate over time without needing window functions.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL example
SELECT resp_body_size_bytes, COUNT(*) / TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, MIN(_time), MAX(_time)) AS rate
FROM http_logs;
```

```kusto APL equivalent
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize rate(resp_body_size_bytes) by bin(_time, 1s)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Syntax

```kusto
rate(field)
```

### Parameters

- `field`: The numeric field for which you want to calculate the rate.

### Returns

Returns the rate of change or occurrence of the specified `field` over the time interval specified in the query.

Specify the time interval in the query in the following way:

- `| summarize rate(field)` calculates the rate value of the field over the entire query window.
- `| summarize rate(field) by bin(_time, 1h)` calculates the rate value of the field over a one-hour time window.
- `| summarize rate(field) by bin_auto(_time)` calculates the rate value of the field bucketed by an automatic time window computed by `bin_auto()`.

<Tip>

Use two `summarize` statements to visualize the average rate over one minute per hour. For example:

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize respBodyRate = rate(resp_body_size_bytes) by bin(_time, 1m)
| summarize avg(respBodyRate) by bin(_time, 1h)
```

## List of related aggregations

- [**count**](/apl/aggregation-function/count): Returns the total number of records. Use `count` when you want an absolute total instead of a rate over time.
- [**sum**](/apl/aggregation-function/sum): Returns the sum of values in a field. Use `sum` when you want to aggregate the total value, not its rate of change.
- [**avg**](/apl/aggregation-function/avg): Returns the average value of a field. Use `avg` when you want to know the mean value rather than how it changes over time.
- [**max**](/apl/aggregation-function/max): Returns the maximum value of a field. Use `max` when you need to find the peak value instead of how often or quickly something occurs.
- [**min**](/apl/aggregation-function/min): Returns the minimum value of a field. Use `min` when youâ€™re looking for the lowest value rather than a rate.
