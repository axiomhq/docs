The `set` statement is used to set a query option.  Options enabled with the `set` statement only have effect for the duration of the query.

The `set` statement specified will affect how your query is processed and the returned results.

## Syntax 

```kusto
set OptionName=OptionValue
```

## Strict types

The `stricttypes` query option lets you specify only the exact type of the data type declaration needed in your query, or a **QueryFailed** error will be thrown.

## Example 

```kusto
set stricttypes; 
['Dataset'] 
| where number == 5
```
