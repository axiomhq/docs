Axiom offers the following approaches to capture generative AI telemetry:

| Approach                  | Language support | Characteristics                                                   |
|---------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Automatic instrumentation | TypeScript       | Quick setup.<br/>Minimal code changes.                            |
| Manual instrumentation    | Any              | More involved setup.<br/>Full control over instrumentation.       |


**Automatic instrumentation** is the right choice for you if you have a TypeScript app and you want the Axiom AI SDK to automatically capture and send traces with the correct semantic conventions.

**Manual instrumentation** is the right choice for you if you want to use your own tooling or if you use a language other than TypeScript. You need to instrument your app manually to emit traces compatible with Axiomâ€™s AI engineering features.

Both approaches emit identical attributes. This means that all the telemetry analysis features work the same way.
