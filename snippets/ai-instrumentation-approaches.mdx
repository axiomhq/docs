Axiom offers the following approaches to capture generative AI telemetry:

| Instrumentation approach    | Language support | Characteristics                                                   |
|:-----------------------------|:------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Axiom AI SDK](/ai-engineering/observe/axiom-ai-sdk-instrumentation)                | TypeScript       | Quick setup.<br/>Minimal code changes.                            |
| [Manual](/ai-engineering/observe/manual-instrumentation)                      | Any              | More involved setup.<br/>Full control over instrumentation.       |

**Instrumentation with Axiom AI SDK** is the right choice for you if you have a TypeScript app and you want the SDK to capture and send traces with the correct semantic conventions.

**Manual instrumentation** is the right choice for you if you want to use your own tooling or if you use a language other than TypeScript. You need to instrument your app manually to emit traces compatible with Axiomâ€™s AI engineering features.

Both approaches emit identical attributes. This means that all the telemetry analysis features work the same way.
