### Access to datasets

The datasets that individual users have access to determines the following:

- The data they see in dashboards. If a user has access to a dashboard but only to some of the datasets referenced in the dashboardâ€™s elements, the user only sees data from the datasets they have access to.
- The monitors they see. A user only sees the monitors that reference the datasets that the user has access to. If a user has access to the monitors of an organization but only to some of the datasets referenced in the monitors, the user only sees the monitors that reference the datasets they have access to. If a monitor joins several datasets, a user can only see the monitor if the user has access to all of the datasets.
