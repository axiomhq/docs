The Axiom Cookbook is a collection of practical recipes that solve real-world AI engineering problems. Each recipe is a self-contained walkthrough with copy-paste-ready code.

Scan the table below to find recipes by the features they cover.

## Prerequisites

Most recipes assume you have:

- An [Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/register) with a dataset for AI telemetry
- [Axiom AI SDK](/ai-engineering/quickstart) installed and configured
- A TypeScript project using [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev)

Individual recipes list additional requirements in their Prerequisites section.
