The Axiom Cookbook is a collection of practical recipes that demonstrate how to solve real-world AI engineering problems. Each recipe is a self-contained walkthrough with copy-paste-ready code that you can adapt to your own projects.

## Prerequisites

Most recipes assume you have:

- An [Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/register) with a dataset for AI telemetry
- [Axiom AI SDK](/ai-engineering/quickstart) installed and configured
- A TypeScript project using [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev)

Individual recipes list additional requirements in their Prerequisites section.

## How recipes are structured

Each recipe follows a consistent format:

1. **Introduction** explaining the problem and when to use the recipe
2. **Prerequisites** listing what you need before starting
3. **Step-by-step walkthrough** with code examples
4. **Verification** showing how to confirm the recipe worked
5. **What's next** linking to related recipes and reference docs
