# Contribution guidelines

Axiom encourages you to participate in this documentation project. The community appreciates your help in making Axiom as easy to understand and work with as possible.

To contribute, fork this repo, and then clone it. For more information, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project).

Before contributing, please read the following guidelines and the [Code of conduct](/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT).

## Submit an issue

If you find a mistake in the documentation or notice unexpected behavior of the documentation site, submit an issue to the repo.

Before you submit your issue, search open and closed issues to avoid duplicates. It’s possible that your question was already answered, or a ticket for the issue already exists.

## Look for issues

If you want to contribute but don’t know where to start, browse the open issues in this repo. Some issues are labelled as **Contributor friendly**.

## Guidelines for authors

- In your contributions, comply with the [Google style guide](https://developers.google.com/style). Use Vale to check your contribution for stylistic consistency.
- Before starting work on an issue, search the repo for open or closed pull requests (PRs) that relate to your submission to avoid duplicate effort.
- Associate each PR with a specific Issue. If an issue doesn’t exist, create it first.
- Only create a PR if you intend to merge it soon. If your work isn’t ready for review, keep it as a branch.
- When you create a PR, add a descriptive title that starts with an action verb (add, update, fix, etc.). Reference all supporting material in the description to make the reviewer’s task easier.
- Before asking for review, build the website locally to make sure everything works as expected. Check the spelling with Grammarly or something similar.
- After asking for review, don’t commit to the branch until the reviewer has finished. If you need to fix something, ask the reviewer for permission to commit.
- Before merging, check the spelling with Grammarly or something similar, and check style using Vale.

## Guidelines for reviewers

- When you review a PR, use GitHub suggestions for changes where discussion is necessary. For major changes or uncontroversial smaller fixes, commit directly to the branch.
- Let the original creator merge the PR. The reviewer only approves or asks for changes.
- In your comments, be kind, considerate, and constructive.
- If a comment doesn’t apply to the review of the PR, post it on the related issue.

## Commits

- In your PR, ensure each commit has a single clear purpose. If you made multiple unrelated changes, split the changes into separate commits.
- When merging a branch to `main`, squash all commits to keep a clean history.
