<Warning>
You can use this endpoint to query data from any edge deployment. However, query results are routed through the US East 1 (AWS) deployment. To query your edge data without results leaving the relevant region, use the [Run query (edge)](/restapi/endpoints/queryAplEdge) endpoint. For more information, see [Edge deployments](/reference/edge-deployments).
