This page explains how to manage datasets programmatically via the API.

<Prerequisites />
- [Create an API token in Axiom](/reference/tokens) with permissions to create, read, update, and delete datasets.
- In the code samples below, replace `API_TOKEN` with the Axiom API token you have generated. For added security, store the API token in an environment variable.

## Create datasets

To create a dataset, send a POST request to the `datasets` endpoint. In the body of the request, specify the name and the description of the dataset. For example:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://AXIOM_DOMAIN/v2/datasets' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN' \
-d '{
    "description": "This is a test dataset.",
    "name": "test_dataset"
  }'
```

<Info>
<ReplaceDomain />
<ReplaceToken />
</Info>

The example response contains the dataset ID that you can later use to access the dataset programmatically.

```json
{
  "canWrite": true,
  "created": "2025-07-02T09:40:53.327Z",
  "description": "This is a test dataset.",
  "id": "test_dataset",
  "mapFields": null,
  "name": "test_dataset",
  "retentionDays": 0,
  "useRetentionPeriod": false,
  "who": ""
}
```

For more information, see the [API reference](/restapi/endpoints/createDataset).

## Get information about datasets

### Get information about all datasets

To get information about all the datasets in your Axiom organization, send a GET request to the `datasets` endpoint. For example:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' 'https://AXIOM_DOMAIN/v2/datasets' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN'
```

<Info>
<ReplaceDomain />
<ReplaceToken />
</Info>

The example response is a list of dataset objects. Each object contains a unique dataset ID that you can later use to access the dataset programmatically.

```json
[
    {
        "canWrite": true,
        "created": "2025-05-26T09:39:47.909Z",
        "description": "This is a test dataset.",
        "id": "test_dataset1",
        "mapFields": null,
        "name": "test_dataset1",
        "retentionDays": 0,
        "useRetentionPeriod": false,
        "who": ""
    },
    {
        "canWrite": true,
        "created": "2025-07-02T09:40:53.327Z",
        "description": "This is another test dataset.",
        "id": "test_dataset2",
        "mapFields": null,
        "name": "test_dataset2",
        "retentionDays": 0,
        "useRetentionPeriod": false,
        "who": ""
    }
]
```

For more information, see the [API reference](/restapi/endpoints/getDatasets).

### Get information about specific dataset

To get information about a specific dataset, send a GET request to the `datasets/ID` endpoint where `ID` is the unique ID of the dataset. For example:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' 'https://AXIOM_DOMAIN/v2/datasets/test_dataset' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN'
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "canWrite": true,
  "created": "2025-07-02T09:40:53.327Z",
  "description": "This is a test dataset.",
  "id": "test_dataset",
  "mapFields": null,
  "name": "test_dataset",
  "retentionDays": 0,
  "useRetentionPeriod": false,
  "who": ""
}
```

For more information, see the [API reference](/restapi/endpoints/getDataset).

## Update datasets

To update a dataset, send a PUT request to the `datasets/ID` endpoint where `ID` is the unique ID of the dataset. In the body of the request, specify the properties you want to update. For example:

```bash
curl -X 'PUT' 'https://AXIOM_DOMAIN/v2/datasets/test_dataset' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN' \
-d '{
    "description": "This is a production dataset."
  }'
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "canWrite": true,
  "created": "2025-07-02T09:40:53.327Z",
  "description": "This is a production dataset.",
  "id": "test_dataset",
  "mapFields": null,
  "name": "test_dataset",
  "retentionDays": 0,
  "useRetentionPeriod": false,
  "who": ""
}
```

For more information, see the [API reference](/restapi/endpoints/updateDataset).

## Delete datasets

To delete a dataset, send a DELETE request to the `datasets/ID` endpoint where `ID` is the unique ID of the dataset. For example:

```bash
curl -X 'DELETE' 'https://AXIOM_DOMAIN/v2/datasets/test_dataset' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN'
```

For more information, see the [API reference](/restapi/endpoints/deleteDataset).
