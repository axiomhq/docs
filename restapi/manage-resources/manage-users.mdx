This page explains how to manage users programmatically via the API.

<Prerequisites />
{/* list separator */}
- [Create an API token in Axiom](/reference/tokens) with permissions to create, read, update, and delete datasets.
- In the code samples below, replace `API_TOKEN` with the Axiom API token you have generated. For added security, store the API token in an environment variable.

## Create users

To create a user, send a POST request to the `users` endpoint. In the body of the request, specify the following:
- `name` 

For example:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://api.axiom.co/v2/users' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN' \
-d '{
    "name": "test_user",
    "email": "example@abc.com",
    "role": "admin"
  }'
```

The example response contains the user ID that you can later use to access the user programmatically.

```json
{
  "email": "example@abc.com",
  "id": "abc123",
  "name": "test_user",
  "role": {
    "id": "admin",
    "name": "admin"
  }
}
```

For more information, see the [API reference](/restapi/endpoints/createUser).

## Get information about users

### Get information about all users

To get information about all the users in your Axiom organization, send a GET request to the `users` endpoint. For example:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' 'https://api.axiom.co/v2/users' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN'
```

The example response is a list of user objects. Each object contains a unique user ID that you can later use to access the user programmatically.

```json
[
  {
    "email": "example1@abc.com",
    "id": "abc123",
    "name": "test_user1",
    "role": {
      "id": "admin",
      "name": "admin"
    }
  },
  {
    "email": "example2@abc.com",
    "id": "abc321",
    "name": "test_user2",
    "role": {
      "id": "admin",
      "name": "admin"
    }
  }
]
```

For more information, see the [API reference](/restapi/endpoints/getUsers).

### Get information about specific user

To get information about a specific user, send a GET request to the `users/ID` endpoint where `ID` is the unique ID of the user. For example:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' 'https://api.axiom.co/v2/users/abc123' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN'
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "email": "example@abc.com",
  "id": "abc123",
  "name": "test_user",
  "role": {
    "id": "admin",
    "name": "admin"
  }
}
```

For more information, see the [API reference](/restapi/endpoints/getUser).

## Update users

To update a user, send a PUT request to the `users/ID` endpoint where `ID` is the unique ID of the user. In the body of the request, specify the properties you want to update. Include the `name` field even if you donâ€™t want to change it. For example:

```bash
curl -X 'PUT' 'https://api.axiom.co/v2/users/abc123' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN' \
-d '{
    "name": "test_user",
    "email": "example2@abc.com",
  }'
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "email": "example2@abc.com",
  "id": "abc123",
  "name": "test_user",
  "role": {
    "id": "admin",
    "name": "admin"
  }
}
```

For more information, see the [API reference](/restapi/endpoints/updateUser).

## Delete users

To delete a user, send a DELETE request to the `users/ID` endpoint where `ID` is the unique ID of the user. For example:

```bash
curl -X 'DELETE' 'https://api.axiom.co/v2/users/abc123' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN'
```

For more information, see the [API reference](/restapi/endpoints/deleteUser).
