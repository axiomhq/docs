Axiom understands your resources and provides an API to ingest structured data logs, handle queries, and manage your deployments. This REST-style API uses JSON for serialization and gives you complete control over the entire Axiom platform.

This page covers the basics for interacting with the Axiom API, instructions for ingesting data, and notes on some commonly used endpoints.

You can use the API commands with `curl` by providing your [Access Token](/reference/tokens).

## API Basics

All our endpoints live under the url `https://api.axiom.co` and follow the REST architectural style.

Hereâ€™s an example in **curl**:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/$DATASET_NAME/ingest' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{ "axiom": "logging"}'
```

## Content Type

All requests must be encoded as JSON with the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`. If not otherwise specified, responses from the Axiom API, including errors, are encoded exclusively as JSON as well.

## Datasets

Datasets are required to send, query, and retrieve requests. Datasets are a collection of similar events. When data is sent to Axiom, it is stored in a dataset.

You will need to create or use an existing Dataset to get started with Axiom REST API.

See [Creating a Dataset](/reference/datasets) to get started.

## Authentication

Requests to the Axiom API must provide an API token through the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <$API_TOKEN or $PERSONAL_TOKEN>
```

The `Authorization` header with an access token:

API Tokens can be created and managed from **Settings --> API Tokens** on Axiom UI.

See [Access Tokens](/reference/tokens) for more detail.

## Organization ID

Organization identification is required for you to send requests using [Personal Tokens](/reference/tokens#personal-access-tokens-pat).

The `org id` credentials can be obtained on the **Settings** page.

</Frame>

The `org id` can also be obtained from the `url` of your Axiom deployment.

In your Axiom deployment url `https://app.axiom.co/axiom-wt8j/datasets`, the credential `axiom-wt8j` is the organization ID.

## Failed Authentication

If authentication is unsuccessful for a request, the error status code `403` is returned.

## Types

Below is a list of the types of data used within the Axiom API:

| Name        | Definition                                                        | Example                |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **ID**      | A unique value used to identify resources.                        | "io12h34io1h24i"       |
| **String**  | A sequence of characters used to represent text.                  | "string value"         |
| **Boolean** | A type of two possible values representing true or false.         | true                   |
| **Integer** | A number without decimals.                                        | 4567                   |
| **Float**   | A number with decimals.                                           | 15.67                  |
| **Map**     | A data structure with a list of values assigned to a unique key.  | \{ "key": "value" \}   |
| **List**    | A data structure with only a list of values separated by a comma. | ["value", 4567, 45.67] |
