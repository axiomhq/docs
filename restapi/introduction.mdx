You can use the Axiom API (Application Programming Interface) to send data to Axiom, query data, and manage resources programmatically. This page covers the basics for interacting with the Axiom API.

<Prerequisites />

## API basics

Axiom API follows the REST architectural style and uses JSON for serialization. You can send API requests to Axiom with curl or API tools such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

For example, the following curl command ingests data to an Axiom dataset:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/DATASET_NAME/ingest' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[
    {
      "axiom": "logs"
    }
  ]'
```

For more information, see [Send data to Axiom via API](/restapi/ingest) and [Ingest data endpoint](/restapi/endpoints/ingestIntoDataset).

## Regions

All examples in the Axiom API reference use the base domain `https://api.axiom.co`, which is the default for the US region. If your organization uses the EU region, change the base domain in the examples to `https://api.eu.axiom.co`.

For more information on regions, see [Regions](/reference/regions).

## Content type

Encode the body of API requests as JSON objects and set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`. Unless otherwise specified, Axiom encodes all responses (including errors) as JSON objects.

## Authentication

To prove that API requests come from you, you must include forms of authentication called tokens in your API requests. Axiom offers two types of tokens:

- [API tokens](/reference/tokens#api-tokens) let you control the actions that can be performed with the token. For example, you can specify that requests authenticated with a certain API token can only query data from a particular dataset.
- [Personal access tokens (PATs)](/reference/tokens#personal-access-tokens-pat) provide full control over your Axiom account. Requests authenticated with a PAT can perform every action you can perform in Axiom. When possible, use API tokens instead of PATs.

If you use an API token for authentication, include the API token in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

If you use a PAT for authentication, include the PAT in the `Authorization` header and the org ID in the `x-axiom-org-id` header. For more information, see [Determine org ID](/reference/tokens#determine-org-id).

```bash
Authorization: Bearer {token}
x-axiom-org-id: {org_id}
```

If authentication is unsuccessful for a request, Axiom returns the error status code `403`.

## Data types

Below is a list of the types of data used within the Axiom API:

| Name        | Definition                                                        | Example                |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **ID**      | A unique value used to identify resources.                        | "io12h34io1h24i"       |
| **String**  | A sequence of characters used to represent text.                  | "string value"         |
| **Boolean** | A type of two possible values representing true or false.         | true                   |
| **Integer** | A number without decimals.                                        | 4567                   |
| **Float**   | A number with decimals.                                           | 15.67                  |
| **Map**     | A data structure with a list of values assigned to a unique key.  | \{ "key": "value" \}   |
| **List**    | A data structure with only a list of values separated by a comma. | ["value", 4567, 45.67] |
