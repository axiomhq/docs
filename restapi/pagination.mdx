Pagination allows you to retrieve responses in manageable chunks.

You can use pagination for the following endpoints:
- [Run Query](/restapi/endpoints/queryApl)
- [Run Query (Legacy)](/restapi/endpoints/queryDataset)

## Pagination mechanisms

You can use one of the following pagination mechanisms:

- [Pagination based on timestamp](#timestamp-based-pagination) (stable)
- [Pagination based on cursor](#cursor-based-pagination) (preview)

Axiom recommends timestamp-based pagination. Cursor-based pagination is in preview and may result in data loss.

## Timestamp-based pagination

The parameters and mechanisms differ between the current and legacy endpoints.

### Run Query

To use timestamp-based pagination with the Run Query endpoint:
- Include the [`limit` operator](/apl/tabular-operators/limit-operator) in the APL query of your API request. The argument of this operator determines the number of events to display per page.
- Use `sort by _time asc` or `sort by _time desc` in the APL query. This returns the results in ascending or descending chronological order. For more information, see [sort operator](/apl/tabular-operators/sort-operator).
- Specify `startTime` and `endTime` in the body of your API request.

### Run Query (Legacy)

To use timestamp-based pagination with the legacy Run Query endpoint:
- Add the `limit` parameter to the body of your API request. The value of this parameter determines the number of events to display per page.
- Add the `order` parameter to the body of your API request. In the value of this parameter, order the results by time in either ascending or descending chronological order. For example, `[{ "field": "_time", "desc": true }]`. For more information, see [order operator](/apl/tabular-operators/order-operator).
- Specify `startTime` and `endTime` in the body of your API request.

## Page through the result set

Use the timestamps as boundaries to page through the result set.

### Queries with descending order

To go to the next page of the result set for queries with descending order (`_time desc`):
1. Determine the timestamp of last item on the current page. This is the least recent event.
1. Optional: Subtract 1 nanosecond from the timestamp.
1. In your next request, change the value `endTime` parameter in the body of your API request to the timestamp of the last item (optionally, minus 1 nanosecond).

Repeat this process until the result set is empty.

### Queries with ascending order

To go to the next page of the result set for queries with ascending order (`_time asc`):
1. Determine the timestamp of last item on the current page. This is the most recent event.
1. Optional: Add 1 nanosecond to the timestamp.
1. In your next request, change the value `startTime` parameter in the body of your API request to the timestamp of the last item (optionally, plus 1 nanosecond).

Repeat this process until the result set is empty.

### Deduplication mechanism

In the procedures above, the steps about incrementing the timestamp are optional. If you increment the timestamp, there is a risk of duplication. If you don’t increment the timestamp, there is a risk of overlap. Duplicated data is possible for many reasons, such as backfill or natural duplication from external data sources. For these reasons, regardless of the method you choose (increment or not increment the timestamp, sort by descending or ascending order), Axiom recommends you implement some form of deduplication mechanism in your pagination script.

### Limits

Both the Run Query and the Run Query (Legacy) endpoints allow request-based limit configuration. This means that the limit they use is the lowest of the following: the query limit, the request limit, and Axiom’s server-side internal limit. Without a query or request limit, Axiom currently defaults to the limit of 1,000 events per page. For the pagination of datasets that are greater than 1,000 events, Axioms recommends specifying the same limit in the request and the APL query to avoid the default value and contradictory limits.

### Examples

#### Example request Run Query

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/_apl?format=tabular' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "apl": "dataset | sort by _time desc | limit 100",
    "startTime": "2024-11-30T00:00:00.000Z",
    "endTime": "2024-11-30T23:59:59.999Z"
  }'
```

#### Example request Run Query (Legacy)

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/{dataset_id}/query' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "startTime": "2024-11-30T00:00:00.000Z",
    "endTime": "2024-11-30T23:59:59.999Z",
    "limit": 100,
    "order": [{ "field": "_time", "desc": true }]
  }'
```

#### Example request to page through the result set

Example request to go to next page for Run Query:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/_apl?format=tabular' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "apl": "dataset | sort by _time desc | limit 100",
    "startTime": "2024-11-30T00:00:00.000Z",
    "endTime": "2024-11-30T22:59:59.999Z"
  }'
```

Example request to go to next page for Run Query (Legacy):

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/{dataset_id}/query' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "startTime": "2024-11-30T00:00:00.000Z",
    "endTime": "2024-11-30T22:59:59.999Z",
    "limit": 100,
    "order": [{ "field": "_time", "desc": true }]
  }'
```

## Cursor-based pagination

Cursor-based pagination is in preview and may result in data loss. Axiom recommends timestamp-based pagination.

The parameters and mechanisms differ between the current and legacy endpoints.

### Run Query

To use cursor-based pagination with the Run Query endpoint:
- Include the [`limit` operator](/apl/tabular-operators/limit-operator) in the APL query of your API request. The argument of this operator determines the number of events to display per page.
- Use `sort by _time asc` or `sort by _time desc` in the APL query. This returns the results in ascending or descending chronological order. For more information, see [sort operator](/apl/tabular-operators/sort-operator).
- Specify `startTime` and `endTime` in the body of your API request.

### Run Query (Legacy)

To use cursor-based pagination with the legacy Run Query endpoint:
- Add the `limit` parameter to the body of your API request. The value of this parameter determines the number of events to display per page.
- Add the `order` parameter to the body of your API request. In the value of this parameter, order the results by time in either ascending or descending chronological order. For example, `[{ "field": "_time", "desc": true }]`. For more information, see [order operator](/apl/tabular-operators/order-operator).
- Specify `startTime` and `endTime` in the body of your API request.

### Response format

<ResponseField name="status" type="object">
  Contains metadata about the response including pagination information.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="status.minCursor" type="string">
  Cursor for the first item in the current page.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="status.maxCursor" type="string">
  Cursor for the last item in the current page.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="status.rowsMatched" type="integer">
  Total number of rows matching the query.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="matches" type="array">
  Contains the list of returned objects.
</ResponseField>

## Page through the result set

To page through the result set, add the `cursor` parameter to the body of your API request.

<ParamField query="cursor" type="string">
  Optional. A cursor for use in pagination. Use the cursor string returned in previous responses to fetch the next or previous page of results.
</ParamField>

The `minCursor` and `maxCursor` fields in the response are boundaries that help you page through the result set.

For queries with descending order (`_time desc`), use `minCursor` from the response as the `cursor` in your next request to go to the next page. You reach the end when your provided `cursor` matches the `minCursor` in the response.

For queries with ascending order (`_time asc`), use `maxCursor` from the response as the `cursor` in your next request to go to the next page. You reach the end when your provided `cursor` matches the `maxCursor` in the response.

If the query returns fewer results than the specified limit, paging can stop.

### Examples
