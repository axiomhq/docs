description: Axiom style guide
globs: 
alwaysApply: true
---

Achieve consistency in Axiom documentation and in-app content. Follow [Google style guide](https://developers.google.com/style) unless noted otherwise.

## Voice & Tone
- **Primary:** Simplicity, conciseness, speed. Inspired by [Simplified Technical English](https://www.asd-ste100.org/).
- **Secondary:** Appealing and playful—but never at the expense of clarity.

## Scope
Document Axiom only. Don't document third-party products (they change without notice). Link to external docs instead—never to competitors.

## Doc Structure
1. **Concept** – Goals, terms (optional), section links
2. **Prerequisites** (optional)
3. **Procedures** – Self-contained steps with code examples
4. **Limitations** (optional)
5. **Reference** (optional) – API links, additional options
6. **What's Next** – Related pages

# Language

## Imperative
Use imperative form for user actions.

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Risky action: goal first | ✓ To delete the document, click **Delete**. |
| Safe action: action first | ✓ Click **Run** to run a query. |
| No conditionals for goals | ✗ If you want to delete the document, click **Delete**. |
| No "please" | ✗ Please check if you have write permission. |

## Modal Verbs
**Avoid modal verbs.** Use alternatives:

| Avoid | Use Instead | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| must, need | imperative | ✓ Name the file. ✗ You must name the file. |
| should | "Recommended:" | ✓ Recommended: Back up data first. |
| can, may, want | "Optional:" | ✓ Optional: Specify max width. |
| may, might | direct statement | ✓ Check if you need to update. ✗ You might need to update. |

## Conditionals
- Place conditional clause **before** main clause
- Use first conditional for expected behavior: *If you leave this field empty, Axiom uses the default name.*
- Acceptable exception for necessary conditions: *This option only has an effect if you also enable X.*

## Jargon & Idioms
- Write simply; minimize abbreviations
- Don't explain general IT knowledge
- Avoid idioms: ✓ "Delete empty files" ✗ "Deal with empty files"

# Grammar & Formatting

## Capitalization
**Use sentence case for everything:** nav items, headings, buttons, checkboxes, menus, forms, tooltips, radio buttons, tables.

| Element | Good | Bad |
|---------|------|-----|
| Heading | Send event data to Axiom | Send Event Data to Axiom |
| Button | Sign up | Sign Up |
| After colon | You and Axiom: The perfect pair | You and Axiom: the perfect pair |

**Brands:** Avoid scare caps (✓ Ebay ✗ eBay). Exception: iPhone.

## Numbers & Units
- Space between number and unit: ✓ 215 GB ✗ 215GB
- No space for B/M/K abbreviations: ✓ 215B ✗ 215 B

## Gender
Use singular "they": *A user enters their login credentials.*

## Abbreviations
- Spell out on first use: *binary large object (blob)*
- Use "for example" not "e.g." — "etc." is acceptable

## Links

| Rule | Good | Bad |
|------|------|-----|
| Don't include articles/punctuation in link | see the [Google docs](url). | see [the Google docs.](url) |
| Code element description outside link | use the [`width`](url) property | use the [`width` property](url) |
| No "click here" | see [Google docs](url) | click [here](url) |
| Cross-reference format | For more information, see [Title](url). | — |

**Contrary to Google:** External links open in new tab.

## Lists
- Introduce with complete sentence ending in colon
- Use numbered lists for sequential procedures
- Use bulleted lists for non-sequential items
- **Contrary to Google:** No lettered lists

## Punctuation
- **Oxford comma:** ✓ before, during, and after ✗ before, during and after
- Comma after introductory phrase: *Based on this information, Axiom calculates...*
- Comma in conditionals when clause comes first

## Spelling
- American English (see [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/))
- Compound words: email, online, website, webpage, ebook
- setup/login (noun) vs set up/log in (verb)

## Vocabulary
- No "please"
- No first-person plural: ✓ "Axiom recommends" ✗ "We recommend"
- "data" is singular: *Your data is safe.*
- Use "for example" not "for instance"
- Use "and" not "&" (except proper names)
- Ellipsis (…) in menus for destroy actions requiring confirmation

# Code & Graphics

## Code Snippets
- Use simple, self-contained examples
- Add comments above goal-specific lines

## Screenshots
- Use many in getting started guides
- Use sparingly elsewhere (UI changes often, hard to maintain)
- Don't screenshot copyable text

## Diagrams
- One-direction arrows unless bidirectional is necessary
- Simple descriptions
- Follow [Lucidchart UML](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-class-diagram)
- Consult Design team

# Placeholders

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| API path parameters | lowercase, `_` separator, `{}` | `v1/datasets/{dataset_name}` |
| Other placeholders | UPPERCASE, `_` separator | `DATASET_NAME` |

Distinguish placeholders from variable names: `AXIOM_API_TOKEN = "<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"` (variable) vs `Bearer <AXIOM_API_TOKEN>` (placeholder).
