Axiom is a data platform designed to efficiently collect, store, and analyze event and telemetry data at massive scale. At its core, Axiom combines a high-performance, proprietary data store with an intelligent Console—helping teams reach actionable insights from their data faster.

Trusted by 30,000+ organizations—from high-growth startups to global enterprises.

## Components

Axiom consists of two fundamental components:

### 1. EventDB

Robust, cost-effective, and scalable datastore specifically optimized for timestamped event data. Built from the ground up to handle the vast volumes and high velocity of event ingestion, EventDB ensures:

* **Scalable data loading:** Events are ingested seamlessly without complex middleware, scaling linearly with no single points of failure.
* **Extreme compression:** Tuned storage format compresses data 25-50x, significantly reducing storage costs and ensuring data remains queryable at any time.
* **Serverless querying:** Axiom spins up ephemeral, serverless runtimes on-demand to execute queries efficiently, minimizing idle compute resources and costs.

Learn more about Axiom’s architecture in the [architecture](/docs/platform-overview/architecture) page.

### 2. Console

Intuitive web app built for exploration, visualization, and monitoring of your data.

* **Real-time exploration:** Effortlessly query and visualize data streams in real-time, providing instant clarity on operational and business conditions.
* **Dynamic visualizations:** Generate insightful visualizations, from straightforward counts to sophisticated aggregations, tailored specifically to your needs.
* **Robust monitoring:** Set up threshold-based and anomaly driven alerts, ensuring proactive visibility into potential issues.

## Why choose Axiom?

* **Cost-efficiency:** Axiom dramatically lowers data ingestion and storage costs compared to traditional observability and logging solutions.
* **Flexible insights:** Real-time query capabilities and an increasingly intelligent UI help pinpoint issues and opportunities without sampling.
* **AI engineering:** Axiom provides specialized features designed explicitly for AI engineering workflows, allowing teams to confidently build, deploy, and optimize AI capabilities.
