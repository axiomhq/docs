## Themes

Axiom continuously ships improvements to its core platform. Beyond these changes, Axiom’s current product development is guided by two parallel focus areas: 

1. Transforming the core data platform into an intelligent assistant
2. Building dedicated tools for teams creating the next generation of AI-powered software.

### Intelligent assistant

Axiom’s Console is evolving from a powerful analysis tool into an intelligent assistant that dramatically accelerates time-to-insight. By augmenting human-led investigations with AI, Axiom helps teams move from reactive troubleshooting to proactive action.

Learn more in the [Intelligence](/console/intelligence) docs.

### Confident AI engineering

As teams incorporate more AI capabilities into their own products, they need confidence that those features are performing as expected. Axiom is building a dedicated suite of tools to bring the rigor of observability to the entire AI development lifecycle.

Learn more in the [AI engineering](/ai-engineering/overview) docs.


### Platform excellent and scale

Supporting ambitious builders requires a rock-solid and scalable foundation. Axiom continues to invest heavily in core performance, reliability, and capabilities of the Axiom platform to ensure it can handle the most demanding workloads.

* **Full observability coverage**: Axiom is working to make **Metrics** a generally available, first-class citizen within the data platform, completing the "three pillars of observability" and providing a unified platform for all your telemetry.
* **Global architecture**: Axiom is being re-architected for global scale and efficiency. This includes building out a multi-region edge infrastructure and overhauling storage to support millions of datasets, ensuring high availability and low latency.

## Feature states

Each feature of Axiom is in one of the following states:

- **In development:** Axiom is actively building this feature. It’s not available yet but it’s progressing towards Preview.
- **Private preview:** An early access feature available to selected customers which helps Axiom validate the feature with trusted partners.
- **Public preview:** The feature is available for everyone to try but may have some rough edges. Axiom is gathering feedback before making it GA.
- **Generally available (GA):** The feature is fully released, production-ready, and supported. Feel free to use it in your workflows.
- **Planned end of life:** The feature is scheduled to be retired. It’s still working but you should start migrating to alternative solutions.
- **End of life:** The feature is no longer available or supported. Axiom has sunset it in favor of newer solutions.

<Warning>
Private and public preview features are experimental, are not guaranteed to work as expected, and may return unexpected query results. Please consider the risk you run when you use preview features against production workloads.
</Warning>
