| Component | Sub-Component | Feature | Description |
| :--------- | :------------ | :------ | :---------- |
| **Data Platform** | Deployment | Axiom Cloud | Axiom hosts and manages all infrastructure in its own cloud. |
|  |  |  |  |
| **EventDB** | - | - | Foundation of Axiom's platform for ingesting, storing, and querying timestamped event data at scale. |
| **EventDB** | Ingest | - | Ingest pipeline that is coordination-free, durable by default, and scales linearly without requiring Kafka or other heavy middleware. |
| **EventDB** | Storage | - | Custom block-based format on object storage, with extreme compression (average 25×, up to 50× for more structured events) and efficient metadata. |
| **EventDB** | Query | - | Serverless ephemeral runtimes that spin up on demand to process queries, powered by the Axiom Processing Language (APL). |
| **EventDB** | Query | [APL (Axiom Processing Language)](/apl/introduction) | Powerful query language supporting filtering, aggregations, transformations, and specialized operators. |
| **EventDB** | Query | [Virtual Fields](/query-data/virtual-fields) | Ability to derive new values from data in real-time during queries without pre-structuring or transforming data during ingestion. |
|  |  |  |  |
| **Console** | - | - | Web UI for data management, querying, dashboarding, monitoring, and user administration. |
| **Console** | Query | [Simple Query Builder](/query-data/explore) | Guided interface to quickly filter and group data. |
| **Console** | Query | [Advanced Query Builder](/query-data/explore) | A full APL-based environment for complex aggregations, transformations, and correlations. |
| **Console** | Query | [Visualizations](/query-data/visualizations) | Charts, graphs, and other visual components to make sense of query results. |
| **Console** | Query | [Trace Waterfall](/query-data/traces) | Dedicated interface for analyzing distributed traces. |
| **Console** | Stream | [Live Tailing](/query-data/stream) | Real-time streaming view of incoming logs and events. |
| **Console** | Dashboards | - | Combine multiple visual elements (charts, tables, logs, etc.) onto a single page. |
| **Console** | Dashboards | [Elements](/dashboard-elements/overview) | Various chart types, log streams, notes, and more to tailor each dashboard. |
| **Console** | Dashboards | [Annotations](/query-data/annotate-charts) | Mark points in time or highlight events directly in your dashboards. |
| **Console** | Monitors | [Threshold Monitors](/monitor-data/threshold-monitors) | Checks if aggregated values exceed or fall below a predefined threshold (e.g., error counts > 100). |
| **Console** | Monitors | [Match Monitors](/monitor-data/match-monitors) | Triggers on specific log patterns or conditions for each event. |
| **Console** | Monitors | [Anomaly Monitors](/monitor-data/anomaly-monitors) | Learns from historical data to detect unexpected deviations or spikes. |
| **Console** | Alerting | [Notifiers](/monitor-data/notifiers-overview) (Webhooks, Email, Slack, and more) | Sends notifications through various channels including email, chat platforms, incident management systems, and custom webhook integrations. |
| **Console** | Governance | [Dataset Management](/reference/datasets) | Data retention controls, trim functionality, field vacuuming, and dataset sharing capabilities. |
| **Console** | Governance | [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/reference/settings) | Fine-grained permissions at the organization and dataset levels. |
| **Console** | Governance | [Audit Logs](/reference/audit-log) | Track every change and action taken by users within Axiom. |
| | | | |
| **Integrations** | - | - | A wide range of official and community tools to collect logs, metrics, and traces and send them into Axiom. |
| **Integrations** | Popular Connectors | Cribl, Fluent Bit, Vector, OpenTelemetry, Syslog | Common shippers and pipeline tools for bridging data sources to Axiom. |
| **Integrations** | AWS | CloudWatch Forwarder, Lambda Extension, Kinesis, S3 | Official AWS-based ingestion solutions. |
| **Integrations** | Language Libraries | Go, Python, Node.js, Java, Ruby, Rust, .NET | SDKs to send logs and metrics directly from applications. |
| | | | |
| **APIs and CLI** | - | - | Programmatic and command-line interfaces for ingesting, querying, and managing Axiom resources. |
| **APIs and CLI** | REST API | [Endpoints](/restapi/introduction) | Programmatic interfaces for ingesting data, running queries, retrieving results, and managing annotations and tokens. |
| **APIs and CLI** | REST API | [API Tokens and Personal Access Tokens](/reference/tokens) | Authentication mechanisms for API access with basic and advanced tokens, plus personal tokens. |
| **APIs and CLI** | CLI | Auth and Dataset Management | Create datasets, set tokens, or update config from a shell. |
| **APIs and CLI** | CLI | Query from Terminal | Execute queries in APL or simpler filters directly in a command-line session. |
| **APIs and CLI** | Terraform Provider | - | Terraform provider for programmatically creating and managing Axiom resources including datasets, notifiers, monitors, and users. |
| | | | |
| **Security and Compliance** | - | - | Axiom's data protection measures and compliance with major privacy/security frameworks. |
| **Security and Compliance** | Compliance | SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA | Meets industry standards for data handling and privacy. |
