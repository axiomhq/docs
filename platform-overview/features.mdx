| **Data Platform** | Deployment | Axiom Cloud | Axiom hosts and manages all infrastructure in its own cloud. |
|  |  |  |  |
| **EventDB** | - | - | Foundation of Axiom’s platform for ingesting, storing, and querying timestamped event data at scale. |
| **EventDB** | Ingest | - | Ingest pipeline that’s coordination-free, durable by default, and scales linearly without requiring Kafka or other heavy middleware. |
| **EventDB** | Storage | - | Custom block-based format on object storage, with extreme compression (average 25×, up to 50× for more structured events) and efficient metadata. |
| **EventDB** | Query | - | Serverless ephemeral runtimes that spin up on demand to process queries, powered by the Axiom Processing Language (APL). |
| **EventDB** | Query | [APL (Axiom Processing Language)](/apl/introduction) | Powerful query language supporting filtering, aggregations, transformations, and specialized operators. |
| **EventDB** | Query | [Virtual fields](/query-data/virtual-fields) | Ability to derive new values from data in real-time during queries without pre-structuring or transforming data during ingestion. |
|  |  |  |  |
| **MetricsDB** | - | - | Dedicated metrics datastore purpose-built for high-cardinality time-series data without the cost penalties of traditional metrics systems. |
| **MetricsDB** | Ingest | [OpenTelemetry Metrics](/send-data/opentelemetry) | Native support for OpenTelemetry (gRPC over HTTP) metrics protocol. |
| **MetricsDB** | Storage | High-cardinality native | Store metrics with high-cardinality tags without performance degradation. |

| **Console** | Query | [Visualizations](/query-data/visualizations) | Charts, graphs, and other visual components to make sense of query results. |
| **Console** | Query | [Trace waterfall](/query-data/traces) | Dedicated interface for analyzing distributed traces. |
| **Console** | Query | [Saved queries](/query-data/datasets#saved-queries) | Save and share queries with team members for easy reuse. |
| **Console** | Query | [Views](/query-data/views) | Apply filters and transformations to datasets to create reusable virtual tables with scoped access control. |
| **Console** | Stream | [Live tailing](/query-data/stream) | Real-time streaming view of incoming logs and events. |
| **Console** | Dashboards | - | Combine multiple visual elements (charts, tables, logs, etc.) onto a single page. |
| **Console** | Dashboards | [AI-powered dashboard generation](/dashboards/create#generate-dashboards-using-ai) | Describe requirements in natural language and generate complete dashboards instantly. |
| **Console** | Dashboards | [Elements](/dashboard-elements/create) | Various chart types, log streams, notes, and more to tailor each dashboard. |
| **Console** | Dashboards | [Annotations](/query-data/annotate-charts) | Mark points in time or highlight events directly in your dashboards. |
| **Console** | Monitors | [Threshold monitors](/monitor-data/threshold-monitors) | Checks if aggregated values exceed or fall below a predefined threshold (for example, error counts > 100). |
| **Console** | Monitors | [Match monitors](/monitor-data/match-monitors) | Triggers on specific log patterns or conditions for each event. |
| **Console** | Monitors | [Anomaly monitors](/monitor-data/anomaly-monitors) | Learns from historical data to detect unexpected deviations or spikes. |
| **Console** | Alerting | [Notifiers](/monitor-data/notifiers-overview) (Webhooks, Email, Slack, and more) | Sends notifications through various channels including email, chat platforms, incident management systems, and custom webhook integrations. |
| **Console** | Governance | [Dataset management](/reference/datasets) | Data retention controls, trim functionality, field vacuuming, and dataset sharing capabilities. |
| **Console** | Governance | [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/reference/settings) | Fine-grained permissions at the organization and dataset levels. |
