The **Create** stage is about defining a new AI <Tooltip tip={definitions.Capability}>capability</Tooltip> as a structured, version-able asset in your codebase. The goal is to move away from scattered, hard-coded string prompts and toward a more disciplined and organized approach to prompt engineering.

### Defining a capability as a prompt object

In Axiom AI engineering, every capability is represented by a `Prompt` object. This object serves as the single source of truth for the capability’s logic, including its messages, metadata, and the schema for its arguments.

For now, these `Prompt` objects can be defined and managed as TypeScript files within your own project repository.

A typical `Prompt` object looks like this:

```ts /src/prompts/email-summarizer.prompt.ts
import { 
  experimental_Type,
  type experimental_Prompt 
} from 'axiom/ai';

export const emailSummarizerPrompt = {
  name: "Email Summarizer",
  slug: "email-summarizer",
  version: "1.0.0",
  model: "gpt-4o",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content:
        `Summarize emails concisely, highlighting action items.
        The user is named {{ username }}.`,
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Please summarize this email: {{ email_content }}",
    },
  ],
  arguments: {
    username: experimental_Type.String(),
    email_content: experimental_Type.String(),
  },
} satisfies experimental_Prompt;
```

### Strongly-typed arguments with `Template`

To ensure that prompts are used correctly, the Axiom’s AI SDK includes a `Template` type system (exported as `Type`) for defining the schema of a prompt’s `arguments`. This provides type safety, autocompletion, and a clear, self-documenting definition of what data the prompt expects.

The `arguments` object uses `Template` helpers to define the shape of the context:

```typescript /src/prompts/report-generator.prompt.ts
import { 
  experimental_Type,
  type experimental_Prompt
} from 'axiom/ai';

export const reportGeneratorPrompt = {
  // ... other properties
  arguments: {
    company: experimental_Type.Object({
      name: experimental_Type.String(),
      isActive: experimental_Type.Boolean(),
      departments: experimental_Type.Array(
        experimental_Type.Object({
          name: experimental_Type.String(),
          budget: experimental_Type.Number(),
        })
      ),
    }),
    priority: experimental_Type.Union([
      experimental_Type.Literal("high"),
      experimental_Type.Literal("medium"),
      experimental_Type.Literal("low"),
    ]),
  },
} satisfies experimental_Prompt;
```

You can even infer the exact TypeScript type for a prompt’s context using the `InferContext` utility.

### Prototyping and local testing

Before using a prompt in your application, you can test it locally using the `parse` function. This function takes a `Prompt` object and a `context` object, rendering the templated messages to verify the output. This is a quick way to ensure your templating logic is correct.

```typescript
import { experimental_parse } from 'axiom/ai';
import { 
  reportGeneratorPrompt
} from './prompts/report-generator.prompt';

const context = {
  company: {
    name: 'Axiom',
    isActive: true,
    departments: [
      { name: 'Engineering', budget: 500000 },
      { name: 'Marketing', budget: 150000 },
    ],
  },
  priority: 'high' as const,
};

// Render the prompt with the given context
const parsedPrompt = await experimental_parse(
  reportGeneratorPrompt, { context }
);

console.log(parsedPrompt.messages);
// [
//   {
//     role: 'system',
//     content: 'Generate a report for Axiom.\nCompany Status: Active...'
//   }
// ]
```

### Managing prompts with Axiom

To enable more advanced workflows and collaboration, Axiom is building tools to manage your prompt assets centrally.

* <Badge>Coming soon</Badge> The `axiom` CLI will allow you to `push`, `pull`, and `list` prompt versions directly from your terminal, synchronizing your local files with the Axiom platform.
* <Badge>Coming soon</Badge> The SDK will include methods like `axiom.prompts.create()` and `axiom.prompts.load()` for programmatic access to your managed prompts. This will be the foundation for A/B testing, version comparison, and deploying new prompts without changing your application code.

### What’s next?

Now that you’ve created and structured your capability, the next step is to measure its quality against a set of known good examples.
