Building an AI <Tooltip tip={definitions.Capability}>capability</Tooltip> starts with prototyping. You can use whichever framework you prefer. Axiom is focused on helping you evaluate and observe your capabilities rather than prescribing how to build them.

TypeScript-based frameworks like Vercel’s [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai) do integrate most seamlessly with Axiom’s tooling today, but that’s likely to evolve over time.

## Build your capability

Define your capability using your framework of choice. Here’s an example using Vercel's [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/), which includes [many examples](https://sdk.vercel.ai/examples) covering different capability design patterns. Popular alternatives like [Mastra](https://mastra.ai) also exist.

```ts src/lib/capabilities/classify-ticket.ts expandable
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { wrapAISDKModel } from 'axiom/ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

export async function classifyTicket(input: { 
  subject?: string; 
  content: string 
}) {
  const result = await generateObject({
    model: wrapAISDKModel(openai('gpt-4o-mini')),
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'system',
        content: 'Classify support tickets as: question, bug_report, or feature_request.',
      },
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: input.subject 
          ? `Subject: ${input.subject}\n\n${input.content}` 
          : input.content,
      },
    ],
    schema: z.object({
      category: z.enum(['question', 'bug_report', 'feature_request']),
      confidence: z.number().min(0).max(1),
    }),
  });

  return result.object;
}
```

The `wrapAISDKModel` function instruments your model calls for Axiom’s observability features. Learn more in the [Observe](/ai-engineering/observe) section.

## Gather reference examples

As you prototype, collect examples of inputs and their correct outputs.

```ts
const referenceExamples = [
  {
    input: { 
      subject: 'How do I reset my password?',
      content: 'I forgot my password and need help.' 
    },
    expected: { category: 'question' },
  },
  {
    input: { 
      subject: 'App crashes on startup',
      content: 'The app immediately crashes when I open it.' 
    },
    expected: { category: 'bug_report' },
  },
];
```

These become your ground truth for evaluation. Learn more in the [Evaluate](/ai-engineering/evaluate/overview) section.

## What's next?

Once you have a working capability and reference examples, systematically evaluate its performance.

To learn how to set up and run evaluations, see [Evaluate](/ai-engineering/evaluate/overview).
