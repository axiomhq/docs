The spacer dashboard element adds empty space to your dashboard layout. Use spacers to create visual separation between dashboard elements, improve the organization of your dashboard, and control the positioning of other elements.

<Prerequisites />

## Create spacer

1. Go to the Dashboards tab and open the dashboard to which you want to add the spacer.
1. Click <Icon icon="plus" iconType="regular"/> **Add element** in the top right corner.
1. Click **Spacer** from the list.
1. Click **Save**.

The new element appears in your dashboard. At the bottom, click **Save** to save your changes to the dashboard.

You can resize and reposition the spacer element by dragging its edges or title bar, just like other dashboard elements.
