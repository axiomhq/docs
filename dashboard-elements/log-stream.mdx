The log stream dashboard element displays your logs as they come in real-time. Each log appears as a separate line with various details. The benefit of a log stream is that it provides immediate visibility into your system’s operations. When you’re debugging an issue or trying to understand an ongoing event, the log stream allows you to see exactly what’s happening as it occurs.
