Heatmaps represent the distribution of numerical data by grouping values into ranges or buckets. Each bucket reflects a frequency count of data points that fall within its range. Instead of showing individual events or measurements, heatmaps give a clear view of the overall distribution patterns. This allows you to identify performance bottlenecks, outliers, or shifts in behavior. For instance, you can use heatmaps to track response times, latency, or error rates.

## Interpret heatmaps

Heatmaps use the [`histogram` aggregation](/apl/aggregation-function/histogram) to group values into buckets. To read a heatmap:

- **X-axis (horizontal)**: Represents time, divided into intervals based on the `bin_auto(_time)` or `bin(_time, INTERVAL)` expression in your query.
- **Y-axis (vertical)**: Represents the value ranges (buckets) of the numeric field. Each row corresponds to a bucket boundary from the histogram. For example, if you create a histogram of `req_duration_ms` with 15 bins, the Y-axis shows the bucket boundaries calculated from the data range.
- **Color intensity**: Represents the frequency (count) of data points in each time-value bucket. Darker or more intense colors indicate a higher concentration of events.
- **Legend**: Shows the color scale mapping, where the values represent the count of events in each cell. Higher values correspond to more intense colors.

### Understand bucket boundaries

The histogram function divides the range of your data into equal-width buckets. The number of buckets is determined by the second argument to the `histogram` function. For example, `histogram(req_duration_ms, 15)` creates 15 buckets across the observed range of `req_duration_ms` values. Each bucket label on the Y-axis represents the start of the bucket range.

For more information about how the histogram function works, see [histogram](/apl/aggregation-function/histogram).
