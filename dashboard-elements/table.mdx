import CreateElement from "/snippets/create-dashboard-element.mdx"

The table dashboard element displays a summary of any attributes from your metrics, logs, or traces in a sortable table format. Each row in the table could represent a different service, host, or other entity, with columns showing various attributes or metrics for that entity.

<CreateElement elementName="table" elementButtonLabel="Table"/>

## Example with APL

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| summarize avg(resp_body_size_bytes) by bin_auto(_time)
```

## Combine multiple queries in a table

Each table element uses a single query. To display data from multiple queries in one table, use the [`union`](/apl/tabular-operators/union-operator) operator in your APL query to combine results from multiple datasets or queries.

For example, to combine HTTP logs and security logs in a single table:

```kusto
['sample-http-logs']
| union ['security-logs']
| summarize count() by status, bin_auto(_time)
```

You can also combine multiple queries with different structures. The `union` operator merges compatible fields and preserves all rows from both queries:

```kusto
['web-server-logs']
| project _time, status, method, uri
| union ['api-server-logs']
| project _time, status, method, endpoint
| order by _time desc
```

<Info>
If you need to display data from multiple independent queries that can't be combined with `union`, create separate table elements in your dashboard instead.
