A scatter plot visualizes the correlation or distribution between two distinct metrics or logs. Each point in the scatter plot represents a log entry, with the X and Y axes showing different log attributes (such as request time and response size). You can create a scatter plot chart using either the simple query builder or advanced query builder.

For example, you can plot response size against response time for an API to determine whether larger responses correlate with slower response times.

['sample-http-logs']
| summarize avg(req_duration_ms), avg(resp_header_size_bytes) by resp_body_size_bytes
```
