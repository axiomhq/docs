Scatter plots are used to visualize the correlation or distribution between two distinct metrics or logs. Each point in the scatter plot could represent a log entry, with the X and Y axes showing different log attributes (like request time and response size). The scatter plot chart can be created using the simple query builder or advanced query builder.

For example, plot response size against response time for an API to see if larger responses are correlated with slower response times.

['sample-http-logs']
| summarize avg(req_duration_ms), avg(resp_header_size_bytes) by resp_body_size_bytes
```
