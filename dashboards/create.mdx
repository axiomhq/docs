Dashboards provide a single view into your data. They visualize collections of queries across multiple datasets in one place. Dashboards are easy to share, benefit from collaboration, and bring separate datasets together in a single view.

## Dashboards tab

The Dashboards tab lists the dashboards you have access to.

- The **Integrations** section lists prebuilt dashboards. Axiom automatically built these dashboards as part of the [apps that enrich your Axiom experience](/apps/introduction). The integration dashboards are read-only and you can’t edit them. To create a copy of an integration dashboard that you can edit, [fork the original dashboard](/dashboards/configure#fork-dashboards).
- The sections below list the private and shared dashboards you can access.

To open a dashboard, click a dashboard in the list.

## Create dashboards

To create a dashboard, choose one of the following:

- [Generate a dashboard](#generate-dashboards-using-ai) using AI based on a natural-language prompt.
- [Create an empty dashboard](#create-empty-dashboards).
- [Fork an existing dashboard](#fork-dashboards). This is how you make a copy of prebuilt integration dashboards that you can’t directly edit.
- [Duplicate an existing dashboard](#duplicate-dashboards). This is how you make a copy of dashboards other than prebuilt integration dashboards.

After creating a dashboard:
- [Add dashboard elements](/dashboard-elements/create). For example, add a table or a time series chart.
- [Configure the dashboard](/dashboards/configure). For example, control who can access the dashboard and change the time range.

## Generate dashboards using AI

Explain in your own words what you want to see in your dashboard and Axiom’s AI generates it in seconds.

1. Click the Dashboards tab.
1. In the top right corner, click **New dashboard**.
1. In Type, click **Generate dashboard**.
1. In Dataset, select the dataset from which you want to generate the dashboard.
1. Add a name and a description. Explain in detail what you want to see in your dashboard. The more specific you are, the closer the generated dashboard matches your expectations.

<Note>
You can currently generate dashboards based on a single dataset. After generating the dashboard, you can edit it and add dashboard elements that rely on data from other datasets.
