Dashboards provide a single view into your data.

Axiom provides a mature dashboards experience that allows you to visualize collections of queries across multiple datasets in one place.

Dashboards are easy to share, benefit from collaboration, and bring separate datasets together in a single view.

## Dashboards tab

The Dashboards tab lists the dashboards you have access to.
- The **Integrations** section lists prebuilt dashboards. Axiom automatically built these dashboards as part of the [apps that enrich your Axiom experience](/apps/introduction). The integration dashboards are read-only and you cannot edit them. To create a copy of an integration dashboard that you can edit, [fork the original dashboard](/dashboards/configure#fork-dashboards).
- The sections below list the private and shared dashboards you can access.

To open a dashboard, click a dashboard in the list.
