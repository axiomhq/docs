Axiom MCP Server is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server implementation that enables AI agents to query your data using Axiom Processing Language (APL).

## Current capabilities

Axiom MCP Server supports the following MCP [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools):

- `getDatasetSchema`: Get dataset schema
- `getMonitors`: List monitoring configurations
- `getMonitorsHistory`: Get monitor execution history
- `getSavedQueries`: Retrieve saved APL queries
- `listDatasets`: List available Axiom datasets
- `queryApl`: Execute APL queries against Axiom datasets

Axiom MCP Server supports the following MCP [prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts):

- `correlate-events-across-datasets`: Find patterns and correlations between events across multiple datasets
- `data-quality-investigation`: Investigate data quality issues including missing data, inconsistencies, and collection problems
- `detect-anomalies-in-events`: Generic anomaly detection using statistical analysis and pattern recognition across any dataset
- `establish-performance-baseline`: Establish performance baselines for a dataset to enable effective monitoring and anomaly detection
- `explore-unknown-dataset`: Exploration of an unknown dataset to understand its structure, content, and potential use cases
- `monitor-health-analysis`: Comprehensive analysis of monitor health, alert patterns, and effectiveness

Axiom plans to support MCP [resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources) in the future.

Axiom MCP Server works with all AI agents that support MCP.

<Prerequisites />
- Set up an AI agent that supports MCP. For example, install the [Claude desktop app](https://claude.ai/download).

## Setup

In your AI agent, add a remote MCP connection with the following details:

- **Name:** `Axiom`
- **Server URL:** `https://mcp.axiom.co/mcp`

For AI agents that require server-sent events (SSE), use the server URL `https://mcp.axiom.co/sse`.

For more information, see the documentation of your AI agent. For example:

- [Claude desktop app](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tutorials/use-remote-mcp-server)
- [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/mcp)

When your AI agent first attempts to interact with Axiom MCP Server, authenticate the request in your browser. You can later revoke access on the Profile page of the Axiom web UI.

<Accordion title="Local setup">

The setup explained above uses a remote MCP connection and is the recommended approach for most use cases. Alternatively, you can deploy Axiom MCP Server locally on your machine if you want more control.

### Install

Run the following to install the latest built binary from [GitHub](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-mcp/releases):

```bash
go install github.com/axiomhq/axiom-mcp@latest
```

<Info>
Axiom MCP Server is an open-source project and welcomes your contributions. For more information, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/axiomhq/mcp-server-axiom).

### Create API token

<PrerequisiteToken />

### Configure

Configure your AI agent to use the MCP server in one of the following ways:

- Use a [config file](#config-file)
- Use [environment variables](#environment-variables)

#### Config file

1. Create a config file where you specify the authentication and configuration details. For example:

    ```bash config.txt
    token API_TOKEN
    url https://AXIOM_DOMAIN
    query-rate 1
    query-burst 1
    datasets-rate 1
    datasets-burst 1
    monitors-rate 1
    monitors-burst 1
    ```

    <Info>
    <ReplaceToken />

    <ReplaceDomain />
    </Info>

    Optionally, configure the rate and the burst limits at the query, dataset, and monitor levels. The rate limit is the maximum number of requests that your AI agent can make per second. The burst limit is the maximum number of requests that your AI agent can make in a short period (burst) before the rate limit applies to further requests.

1. In the settings of your AI agent, reference the binary file of Axiom MCP Server and the config file you have previously created.

    For example, if you use the Claude desktop app, add `axiom` to the `mcpServers` section of the Claude configuration file. If you use a Mac, the default path is `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.

    ```json claude_desktop_config.json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "axiom": {
          "command": "PATH_AXIOM_MCP_BINARY",
          "args" : ["--config", "PATH_AXIOM_MCP_CONFIG"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    <Info>
    Replace `PATH_AXIOM_MCP_BINARY` with the path the binary file of Axiom MCP Server. By default, it’s `~/go/bin/axiom-mcp`.

    Replace `PATH_AXIOM_MCP_CONFIG` with the path the config file you have previously created.
    </Info>

#### Environment variables

In the settings of your AI agent, use environment variables to specify the authentication details and the binary file of Axiom MCP Server.

For example, if you use the Claude desktop app, add `axiom` to the `mcpServers` section of the Claude configuration file. If you use a Mac, the default path is `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`. For example:

```json claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "axiom": {
      "command": "PATH_AXIOM_MCP_BINARY",
      "env": {
        "AXIOM_TOKEN": "API_TOKEN",
        "AXIOM_URL": "https://AXIOM_DOMAIN",
        "AXIOM_QUERY_RATE": "1",
        "AXIOM_QUERY_BURST": "1",
        "AXIOM_DATASETS_RATE": "1",
        "AXIOM_DATASETS_BURST": "1",
        "AXIOM_MONITORS_RATE": "1",
        "AXIOM_MONITORS_BURST": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>
Replace `PATH_AXIOM_MCP_BINARY` with the path the binary file of Axiom MCP Server. By default, it’s `~/go/bin/axiom-mcp`.

<ReplaceToken />

<ReplaceDomain />

Optionally, configure the rate and the burst limits at the query, dataset, and monitor levels. The rate limit is the maximum number of requests that your AI agent can make per second. The burst limit is the maximum number of requests that your AI agent can make in a short period (burst) before the rate limit applies to further requests.

## Ask your AI agent about your data

Ask your AI agent questions about your Axiom data. For example:

- “List datasets.”
- “Get the data schema for the dataset `logs`.”
- “Get the most common status codes in the last 30 minutes in the dataset `logs`.”

For more information about the types of questions Axiom MCP Server can help you answer, see [Current capabilities](#current-capabilities).
