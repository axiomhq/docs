1. Find Axiom in the list.
1. Click **Connect**.
1. Authenticate the request in your browser.

If you’re on the Free plan:

1. Install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download).
1. In Claude Desktop, go to **Settings > Developers**, and then click **Edit Config**.
1. Add the following to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

    ```json claude_desktop_config.json
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "axiom": {
                "command": "npx",
                "args": [
                    "-y",
                    "mcp-remote",
                    "https://mcp.axiom.co/mcp"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Restart Claude Desktop.
1. Authenticate the request in your browser.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Cursor">

### Cursor

1. Install [Cursor](https://cursor.com/home).
1. [Install Axiom MCP Server](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=axiom&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5heGlvbS5jby9tY3AifQ%3D%3D).
1. Authenticate the request in your browser.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Other clients">

### Other clients

If your agent supports connecting to remote MCP servers directly:

1. In your AI agent, add a remote MCP connection with the following details:

    - **Name:** `Axiom`
    - **Server URL:** `https://mcp.axiom.co/mcp`

    For AI agents that require server-sent events (SSE), use the server URL `https://mcp.axiom.co/sse`.

1. Authenticate the request in your browser. You can later revoke access on the Profile page of the Axiom Console.

If your agent doesn’t support connecting to remote MCP servers directly, use the [mcp-remote library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote):

1. Add the `mcp-remote` library to the configuration file of your AI agent. For example:

    ```json
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "axiom": {
                "command": "npx",
                "args": [
                    "-y",
                    "mcp-remote",
                    "https://mcp.axiom.co/mcp"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Restart your AI agent.
1. Authenticate the request in your browser.

</Tabs>

The setup explained above uses a remote MCP connection and is the recommended approach for most use cases. Alternatively, deploy Axiom MCP Server locally on your machine for more control.

<Accordion title="Local setup">

## Local setup

With the local setup:

- You run Axiom MCP Server yourself.
- You authenticate using an API token instead of OAuth 2.0.
- You can’t use the MCP prompts mentioned in [Current capabilities](#current-capabilities).

### Install

Run the following to install the latest built binary from [GitHub](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-mcp/releases):

```bash
go install github.com/axiomhq/axiom-mcp@latest
```

<Info>
Axiom MCP Server is an open-source project and welcomes your contributions. For more information, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/axiomhq/mcp-server-axiom).
</Info>

### Create API token

<PrerequisiteToken />

### Configure

Configure your AI agent to use the MCP Server in one of the following ways:

- Use a [config file](#config-file)
- Use [environment variables](#environment-variables)

#### Config file

1. Create a config file where you specify the authentication and configuration details. For example:

    ```bash config.txt
    token API_TOKEN
    url https://AXIOM_DOMAIN
    query-rate 1
    query-burst 1
    datasets-rate 1
    datasets-burst 1
    monitors-rate 1
    monitors-burst 1
    ```

    <Info>
    <ReplaceToken />

    <ReplaceDomain />
    </Info>

    Optionally, configure the rate and the burst limits at the query, dataset, and monitor levels. The rate limit is the maximum number of requests that your AI agent can make per second. The burst limit is the maximum number of requests that your AI agent can make in a short period (burst) before the rate limit applies to further requests.

1. In the settings of your AI agent, reference the binary file of Axiom MCP Server and the config file you have previously created.

    For example, if you use the Claude desktop app, add `axiom` to the `mcpServers` section of the Claude configuration file. The default path is `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on MacOS and `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows.

    ```json claude_desktop_config.json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "axiom": {
          "command": "PATH_AXIOM_MCP_BINARY",
          "args": [
            "--config",
            "PATH_AXIOM_MCP_CONFIG"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    <Info>
    Replace `PATH_AXIOM_MCP_BINARY` with the path the binary file of Axiom MCP Server.

    Replace `PATH_AXIOM_MCP_CONFIG` with the path the config file you have previously created.
    </Info>

#### Environment variables

In the settings of your AI agent, use environment variables to specify the authentication details and the binary file of Axiom MCP Server.

For example, if you use the Claude desktop app, add `axiom` to the `mcpServers` section of the Claude configuration file. The default path is `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on MacOS and `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows.

```json claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "axiom": {
      "command": "PATH_AXIOM_MCP_BINARY",
      "env": {
        "AXIOM_TOKEN": "API_TOKEN",
        "AXIOM_URL": "https://AXIOM_DOMAIN",
        "AXIOM_QUERY_RATE": "1",
        "AXIOM_QUERY_BURST": "1",
        "AXIOM_DATASETS_RATE": "1",
        "AXIOM_DATASETS_BURST": "1",
        "AXIOM_MONITORS_RATE": "1",
        "AXIOM_MONITORS_BURST": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>
Replace `PATH_AXIOM_MCP_BINARY` with the path the binary file of Axiom MCP Server.

<ReplaceToken />

<ReplaceDomain />
</Info>

Optionally, configure the rate and the burst limits at the query, dataset, and monitor levels. The rate limit is the maximum number of requests that your AI agent can make per second. The burst limit is the maximum number of requests that your AI agent can make in a short period (burst) before the rate limit applies to further requests.

## Use MCP Server

After setting up the Axiom MCP Server, you can:

- Ask your own questions about your event data. For example:

    - “List datasets.”
    - “Get the data schema for the dataset `logs`.”
    - “Get the most common status codes in the last 30 minutes in the dataset `logs`.”

- Use the [prebuilt prompts](#supported-mcp-prompts). For example, in Claude, click **+ > Add from Axiom** to access them.

To answer your questions, your AI client can use the [supported MCP tools](#supported-mcp-tools).

## Revoke access

Using the procedure above, you authorized your AI client to access your event data in Axiom.

To revoke access:

1. In Axiom, go to <img src="/doc-assets/icons/settings.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Settings icon" /> **Settings > Profile**.
1. In the Sessions section, find the session where you authorized your AI client, and then click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/delete.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Delete icon" /> **Delete** on the right.

If you connected to Axiom MCP Server using the `mcp-remote` library, clear the `.mcp-auth` folder. This is where Axiom MCP Server stores credential information. On a Mac, the default path is `~/.mcp-auth`.
