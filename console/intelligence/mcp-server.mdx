1. Authenticate the request in your browser.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Other clients">

### Other clients

If your agent supports connecting to remote MCP servers directly:

1. In your AI agent, add a remote MCP connection with the following details:

    - **Name:** `Axiom`
    - **Server URL:** `https://mcp.axiom.co/mcp`

    For AI agents that require server-sent events (SSE), use the server URL `https://mcp.axiom.co/sse`.

1. Authenticate the request in your browser. You can later revoke access on the Profile page of the Axiom Console.

If your agent doesn’t support connecting to remote MCP servers directly, use the [mcp-remote library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote):

1. Add the `mcp-remote` library to the configuration file of your AI agent. For example:

    ```json
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "axiom": {
                "command": "npx",
                "args": [
                    "-y",
                    "mcp-remote",
                    "https://mcp.axiom.co/mcp"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Restart your AI agent.
1. Authenticate the request in your browser. You can later revoke access on the Profile page of the Axiom Console.

### Header-based authentication

If your AI agent doesn’t support browser-based OAuth authentication (for example, Agent Builder from OpenAI), authenticate by passing headers directly:

1. [Create a personal access token](/reference/tokens#personal-access-tokens-pat).
1. [Determine organization ID](/reference/tokens#determine-organization-id).
1. Configure your AI agent to use the server URL `https://mcp.axiom.co/mcp`.
1. Configure your AI agent to send the following headers with each request to the server URL:

    - **Authorization:** `Bearer PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
    - **x-axiom-org-id:** `ORGANIZATION_ID`

    <Info>
    Replace `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the personal access token you have generated.

    <ReplaceOrgId />
    </Info>

    If your AI agent only supports setting the Authorization header, pass the organization ID as a URL parameter: `https://mcp.axiom.co/mcp?org-id=ORGANIZATION_ID`

</Tab>
</Tabs>

The setup explained above uses a remote MCP connection and is the recommended approach for most use cases. Alternatively, deploy Axiom MCP Server locally on your machine for more control.

<Accordion title="Local setup">

## Local setup

With the local setup:

- You run Axiom MCP Server yourself.
- You authenticate using an API token instead of OAuth 2.0.
- You can’t use the MCP prompts mentioned in [Current capabilities](#current-capabilities).

### Install

Run the following to install the latest built binary from [GitHub](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-mcp/releases):

```bash
go install github.com/axiomhq/axiom-mcp@latest
```

<Info>
Axiom MCP Server is an open-source project and welcomes your contributions. For more information, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/axiomhq/mcp-server-axiom).
</Info>

### Create API token

<PrerequisiteToken />

### Configure

Configure your AI agent to use the MCP Server in one of the following ways:

- Use a [config file](#config-file)
- Use [environment variables](#environment-variables)

#### Config file

1. Create a config file where you specify the authentication and configuration details. For example:

    ```bash config.txt
    token API_TOKEN
    url https://api.axiom.co
    query-rate 1
    query-burst 1
    datasets-rate 1
    datasets-burst 1
    monitors-rate 1
    monitors-burst 1
    ```

    <Info>
    <ReplaceToken />
    </Info>

    Optionally, configure the rate and the burst limits at the query, dataset, and monitor levels. The rate limit is the maximum number of requests that your AI agent can make per second. The burst limit is the maximum number of requests that your AI agent can make in a short period (burst) before the rate limit applies to further requests.

1. In the settings of your AI agent, reference the binary file of Axiom MCP Server and the config file you have previously created.

    For example, if you use the Claude desktop app, add `axiom` to the `mcpServers` section of the Claude configuration file. The default path is `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on MacOS and `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows.

    ```json claude_desktop_config.json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "axiom": {
          "command": "PATH_AXIOM_MCP_BINARY",
          "args": [
            "--config",
            "PATH_AXIOM_MCP_CONFIG"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    <Info>
    Replace `PATH_AXIOM_MCP_BINARY` with the path the binary file of Axiom MCP Server.

    Replace `PATH_AXIOM_MCP_CONFIG` with the path the config file you have previously created.
    </Info>

#### Environment variables

In the settings of your AI agent, use environment variables to specify the authentication details and the binary file of Axiom MCP Server.

For example, if you use the Claude desktop app, add `axiom` to the `mcpServers` section of the Claude configuration file. The default path is `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on MacOS and `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows.

```json claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "axiom": {
      "command": "PATH_AXIOM_MCP_BINARY",
      "env": {
        "AXIOM_TOKEN": "API_TOKEN",
        "AXIOM_URL": "https://api.axiom.co",
        "AXIOM_QUERY_RATE": "1",
        "AXIOM_QUERY_BURST": "1",
        "AXIOM_DATASETS_RATE": "1",
        "AXIOM_DATASETS_BURST": "1",
        "AXIOM_MONITORS_RATE": "1",
        "AXIOM_MONITORS_BURST": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>
Replace `PATH_AXIOM_MCP_BINARY` with the path the binary file of Axiom MCP Server.

<ReplaceToken />

<ReplaceDomain />
</Info>

Optionally, configure the rate and the burst limits at the query, dataset, and monitor levels. The rate limit is the maximum number of requests that your AI agent can make per second. The burst limit is the maximum number of requests that your AI agent can make in a short period (burst) before the rate limit applies to further requests.

</Accordion>

## Token hygiene

The remote MCP Server uses OAuth for authentication which handles credential isolation automatically. Agents never see your tokens. You can [revoke access](#revoke-access) at any time.

For the local setup or when using [Axiom Skills](/console/intelligence/skills), you configure API tokens directly. For detailed guidance on secure token configuration, see [Token hygiene for AI agents](/console/intelligence/ai-agents-overview#token-hygiene-for-ai-agents).

## Use MCP Server

After setting up the Axiom MCP Server, you can:

- Ask your own questions about your event data. For example:

    - “List datasets.”
    - “Get the data schema for the dataset `logs`.”
    - “Get the most common status codes in the last 30 minutes in the dataset `logs`.”

- Use the [prebuilt prompts](#supported-mcp-prompts). For example, in Claude, click **+ > Add from Axiom** to access them.

To answer your questions, your AI client can use the [supported MCP tools](#supported-mcp-tools).

## Troubleshoot

### No organizations visible after authentication

If you successfully authenticate but no organizations appear:

- Ensure you complete the OAuth flow in the browser when prompted. Look for a browser tab or window that opened during the connection process.
- If the browser tab didn't open automatically, check your browser's pop-up blocker settings.
- Verify that your Axiom account belongs to an organization. Go to [app.axiom.co](https://app.axiom.co) and check that you can see your organization in the top-left dropdown.
- If you recently joined an organization, sign out and sign back in to refresh your session.

### Connection fails or times out

- Verify your internet connection can reach `https://mcp.axiom.co`.
- If you're behind a corporate proxy or firewall, ensure that `mcp.axiom.co` is allowlisted.
- For the local setup, ensure the binary is installed correctly by running `axiom-mcp --help`.
- If you use the `mcp-remote` library, ensure `npx` works correctly in your environment by running `npx -y mcp-remote --help`.

### Authentication errors with header-based setup

- Verify that your [personal access token](/reference/tokens#personal-access-tokens-pat) is valid and hasn't expired.
- Ensure the `Authorization` header uses the `Bearer` prefix: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`.
- Verify the [organization ID](/reference/tokens#determine-organization-id) is correct and matches the organization associated with your token.

### Tools not appearing in AI client

- Restart your AI client after configuring the MCP connection.
- Verify the connection status in your AI client's MCP settings or developer tools.
- For Claude Desktop, check the MCP Server logs at `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log` on macOS.

## Revoke access

Using the procedure above, you authorized your AI client to access your event data in Axiom.

To revoke access:

1. In Axiom, go to <Icon icon="gear" iconType="solid"/> **Settings > Profile**.
1. In the Sessions section, find the session where you authorized your AI client, and then click <Icon icon="trash" iconType="light"/> **Delete** on the right.

If you connected to Axiom MCP Server using the `mcp-remote` library, clear the `.mcp-auth` folder. This is where Axiom MCP Server stores credential information. On a Mac, the default path is `~/.mcp-auth`.
