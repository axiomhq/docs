Axiom MCP Server is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server implementation that enables AI agents to query your data using Axiom Processing Language (APL).

## Current capabilities

Axiom MCP Server supports the following MCP [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools):

- `getDatasetSchema`: Get dataset schema
- `getMonitors`: List monitoring configurations
- `getMonitorsHistory`: Get monitor execution history
- `getSavedQueries`: Retrieve saved APL queries
- `listDatasets`: List available Axiom datasets
- `queryApl`: Execute APL queries against Axiom datasets

Axiom MCP Server supports the following MCP [prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts):

- `correlate-events-across-datasets`: Find patterns and correlations between events across multiple datasets
- `data-quality-investigation`: Investigate data quality issues including missing data, inconsistencies, and collection problems
- `detect-anomalies-in-events`: Generic anomaly detection using statistical analysis and pattern recognition across any dataset
- `establish-performance-baseline`: Establish performance baselines for a dataset to enable effective monitoring and anomaly detection
- `explore-unknown-dataset`: Exploration of an unknown dataset to understand its structure, content, and potential use cases
- `monitor-health-analysis`: Comprehensive analysis of monitor health, alert patterns, and effectiveness

Axiom plans to support MCP [resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources) in the future.

Axiom MCP Server works with all AI agents that support MCP.

## Setup

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Claude Desktop">


Free
no custom mcp, only mcp in anthropic's directory
Paid
Personal account (you pay) - you get to add your own connector
Organization account (work pays) - the admins choose which mcp's are allowed. They can add custom mcps but they are added globally and then the user has to just auth them locally

Claude.ai (Team, Enterprise)
Navigate to Settings → Integrations → Add more
Enter the following:
Integration name: Axiom
Integration URL: https://mcp.axiom.co/sse
Enable the tools in any new chats

Claude Desktop (Free, Pro)
Claude Desktop requires the mcp-remote bridge. Add to ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "axiom": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.axiom.co/sse"]
    }
  }
}
Restart Claude Desktop after making changes.

Cursor
Cursor supports remote servers natively. Install from the MCP tools directory or add manually in settings.

1. Install the [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download) version 0.7.0 or later.
1. In Claude Desktop, go to **Settings > Developer > MCP Servers**.
1. Click **Add Server**, and then enter the following:
    - **Name:** `Axiom`
    - **URL:** `https://mcp.axiom.co/mcp`
1. Click **Connect**.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Claude.ai">

1. **Access Claude.ai**
   Navigate to claude.ai and sign in to your account.

2. **Enable MCP Features**
   Ensure you have MCP features enabled in your Claude.ai account (available for Pro users).

3. **Add MCP Server**
   Click on your profile icon and navigate to:
   **Settings → Connected Apps**
   Click "Connect New App" and add the Axiom MCP server:

   * **Server URL:** `https://mcp.axiom.co/mcp`

4. **Authenticate**
   Complete the OAuth flow to authenticate with Axiom. The server will then be available in your Claude conversations.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Cursor">

1. Install [Cursor](https://cursor.com/home).
1. Install from the MCP tools directory or add manually in the [Cursor settings](https://www.cursor.com/settings).
1. Restart Cursor to load the Axiom MCP server.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Other clients">

In your AI agent, add a remote MCP connection with the following details:

- **Name:** `Axiom`
- **Server URL:** `https://mcp.axiom.co/mcp`

For AI agents that require server-sent events (SSE), use the server URL `https://mcp.axiom.co/sse`.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

When your AI agent first attempts to interact with Axiom MCP Server, authenticate the request in your browser. You can later revoke access on the Profile page of the Axiom web UI.

The setup explained above uses a remote MCP connection and is the recommended approach for most use cases. Alternatively, deploy Axiom MCP Server locally on your machine for more control.

<Accordion title="Local setup">

## Local setup

With the local setup:

- You run Axiom MCP Server yourself.
- You authenticate using an API token instead of OAuth 2.0.
- You can’t use the MCP prompts mentioned in [Current capabilities](#current-capabilities).

### Install

Run the following to install the latest built binary from [GitHub](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-mcp/releases):

```bash
go install github.com/axiomhq/axiom-mcp@latest
```

<Info>
Axiom MCP Server is an open-source project and welcomes your contributions. For more information, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/axiomhq/mcp-server-axiom).

### Create API token

<PrerequisiteToken />

### Configure

Configure your AI agent to use the MCP server in one of the following ways:

- Use a [config file](#config-file)
- Use [environment variables](#environment-variables)

#### Config file

1. Create a config file where you specify the authentication and configuration details. For example:

    ```bash config.txt
    token API_TOKEN
    url https://AXIOM_DOMAIN
    query-rate 1
    query-burst 1
    datasets-rate 1
    datasets-burst 1
    monitors-rate 1
    monitors-burst 1
    ```

    <Info>
    <ReplaceToken />

    <ReplaceDomain />
    </Info>

    Optionally, configure the rate and the burst limits at the query, dataset, and monitor levels. The rate limit is the maximum number of requests that your AI agent can make per second. The burst limit is the maximum number of requests that your AI agent can make in a short period (burst) before the rate limit applies to further requests.

1. In the settings of your AI agent, reference the binary file of Axiom MCP Server and the config file you have previously created.

    For example, if you use the Claude desktop app, add `axiom` to the `mcpServers` section of the Claude configuration file. The default path is `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on MacOS and `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows.

    ```json claude_desktop_config.json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "axiom": {
          "command": "PATH_AXIOM_MCP_BINARY",
          "args" : ["--config", "PATH_AXIOM_MCP_CONFIG"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    <Info>
    Replace `PATH_AXIOM_MCP_BINARY` with the path the binary file of Axiom MCP Server.

    Replace `PATH_AXIOM_MCP_CONFIG` with the path the config file you have previously created.
    </Info>

#### Environment variables

In the settings of your AI agent, use environment variables to specify the authentication details and the binary file of Axiom MCP Server.

For example, if you use the Claude desktop app, add `axiom` to the `mcpServers` section of the Claude configuration file. The default path is `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on MacOS and `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows.

```json claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "axiom": {
      "command": "PATH_AXIOM_MCP_BINARY",
      "env": {
        "AXIOM_TOKEN": "API_TOKEN",
        "AXIOM_URL": "https://AXIOM_DOMAIN",
        "AXIOM_QUERY_RATE": "1",
        "AXIOM_QUERY_BURST": "1",
        "AXIOM_DATASETS_RATE": "1",
        "AXIOM_DATASETS_BURST": "1",
        "AXIOM_MONITORS_RATE": "1",
        "AXIOM_MONITORS_BURST": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>
Replace `PATH_AXIOM_MCP_BINARY` with the path the binary file of Axiom MCP Server.

<ReplaceToken />

<ReplaceDomain />
</Info>

Optionally, configure the rate and the burst limits at the query, dataset, and monitor levels. The rate limit is the maximum number of requests that your AI agent can make per second. The burst limit is the maximum number of requests that your AI agent can make in a short period (burst) before the rate limit applies to further requests.

## Ask your AI agent about your data

Ask your AI agent questions about your Axiom data. For example:

- “List datasets.”
- “Get the data schema for the dataset `logs`.”
- “Get the most common status codes in the last 30 minutes in the dataset `logs`.”

For more information about the types of questions Axiom MCP Server can help you answer, see [Current capabilities](#current-capabilities).
