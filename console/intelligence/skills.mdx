Axiom Skills are instruction files that give AI coding agents specialized capabilities. Unlike Axiom MCP Server, which provides a standardized protocol for tool discovery and execution, Axiom Skills work by embedding methodology and context directly into the agent's prompt.

For guidance on when to use Axiom Skills and Axiom MCP Server, see [AI agents](/console/intelligence/ai-agents-overview).

## Configure Axiom credentials

All Axiom Skills share the same credential configuration. Create a configuration file at `~/.axiom.toml`:

```toml ~/.axiom.toml
[deployments.dev]
url = "https://api.axiom.co"
token = "API_TOKEN"
org_id = "ORGANIZATION_ID"
```

<Info>
<ReplaceToken />
<ReplaceOrgId />
For token creation and scoping guidance, see [Token hygiene for AI agents](/console/intelligence/ai-agents-overview#token-hygiene-for-ai-agents).

### Use SRE skill

The SRE skill activates automatically when you ask your AI agent about:

- Incident response and debugging
- Root cause analysis
- Log investigation
- Production troubleshooting

Example prompts:

- "Investigate why API latency increased in the last hour"
- "Find the root cause of the 500 errors in production"
- "Analyze error patterns in the logs dataset"

### Memory system

The SRE skill learns from every debugging session. The memory system initializes automatically on first use. Memory persists at `~/.config/amp/memory/axiom-sre/` (global) or `.agents/memory/axiom-sre/` (project/local).

#### Tell the agent to remember things

- `Remember this for next time.`
- `Save this query, it worked.`
- `Add to memory: the orders team uses #orders-oncall.`

#### Learn automatically

The SRE skill automatically captures what works and what doesn't when:

- A query or approach finds the root cause.
- You correct it, and it records what didn't work and what did.
- A debugging session completes successfully.

#### Customize with your own knowledge

Customize the SRE skill by adding your own knowledge to the knowledge base files:

- `kb/facts.md`: Team contacts, Slack channels, conventions.
- `kb/integrations.md`: Database connections, API endpoints.
- `kb/patterns.md`: Failure patterns you've seen before.

## Build dashboards

The build dashboards skill turns AI agents into dashboard design experts:

- **Design methodology**: Decision-first dashboard design with overview-to-drilldown structure
- **Chart types**: Complete reference for Statistic, TimeSeries, Table, Pie, LogStream, Heatmap, and more
- **APL patterns**: Golden signal queries, cardinality guardrails, and time-based aggregations
- **SmartFilters**: Interactive filtering with cascading dropdowns
- **API helpers**: Scripts for creating, updating, and validating dashboards via the Axiom API
- **Templates**: Pre-built dashboard templates for common use cases
