Axiom Skills are instruction files that give AI coding agents specialized capabilities. Unlike Axiom MCP Server, which provides a standardized protocol for tool discovery and execution, Axiom Skills work by embedding methodology and context directly into the agent's prompt.

For guidance on when to use Axiom Skills and Axiom MCP Server, see [AI agents](/console/intelligence/ai-agents-overview).

## Axiom SRE Skill

Axiom SRE Skill turns AI agents into expert SRE investigators:

- **Investigation methodology**: Hypothesis-driven debugging with systematic triage using Golden Signals and USE/RED methods
- **APL query patterns**: Reference materials for constructing effective Axiom queries
- **Memory system**: Persistent storage that learns from debugging sessions, capturing what works and what doesn't
- **API helpers**: Scripts for querying Axiom directly from the agent

<Info>
Axiom SRE Skill is an open-source project and welcomes your contributions. For more information, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-sre).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-sre.git ~/.claude/skills/axiom-sre
    ```

For more information, see the [Claude Code documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).

</Tab>
<Tab title="Cursor">

Clone the Axiom SRE Skill repository to Cursor's Claude-compatible skills directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-sre.git ~/.claude/skills/axiom-sre
    ```

For more information, see the [Cursor documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills).

</Tab>
<Tab title="Other agents">

Clone or copy the Axiom SRE Skill repository to your agent's skills directory and reference it in your agent configuration.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-sre.git
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Configure Axiom credentials

Create a configuration file at `~/.axiom.toml`:

```toml ~/.axiom.toml
[deployments.dev]
url = "https://api.axiom.co"
token = "API_TOKEN"
org_id = "ORGANIZATION_ID"
```

<Info>
<ReplaceToken />
<ReplaceOrgId />
For token creation and scoping guidance, see [Token hygiene for AI agents](/console/intelligence/ai-agents-overview#token-hygiene-for-ai-agents).

### Use Axiom SRE Skill

Axiom SRE Skill activates automatically when you ask your AI agent about:

- Incident response and debugging
- Root cause analysis
- Log investigation
- Production troubleshooting

Example prompts:

- "Investigate why API latency increased in the last hour"
- "Find the root cause of the 500 errors in production"
- "Analyze error patterns in the logs dataset"

### Memory system

Axiom SRE Skill learns from every debugging session. The memory system initializes automatically on first use. Memory persists at `~/.config/amp/memory/axiom-sre/` (global) or `.agents/memory/axiom-sre/` (project/local).

#### Tell the agent to remember things

- `Remember this for next time.`
- `Save this query, it worked.`
- `Add to memory: the orders team uses #orders-oncall.`

#### Learn automatically

Axiom SRE Skill automatically captures what works and what doesn't when:

- A query or approach finds the root cause.
- You correct it, and it records what didn't work and what did.
- A debugging session completes successfully.

#### Customize with your own knowledge

Customize the Axiom SRE Skill by adding your own knowledge to the knowledge base files:

- `kb/facts.md`: Team contacts, Slack channels, conventions.
- `kb/integrations.md`: Database connections, API endpoints.
- `kb/patterns.md`: Failure patterns you've seen before.
