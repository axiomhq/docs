Axiom Skills are instruction files that give AI coding agents specialized capabilities. Unlike Axiom MCP Server, which provides a standardized protocol for tool discovery and execution, Axiom Skills work by embedding methodology and context directly into the agent's prompt.

For guidance on when to use Axiom Skills and Axiom MCP Server, see [AI agents](/console/intelligence/ai-agents-overview).

<Info>
Axiom Skills are open-source and welcome your contributions. For more information, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/axiomhq/skills).

```

This command automatically detects your agent and installs all available skills to the appropriate location.

To install skills for a specific agent or install individual skills, see the installation instructions on each skill page.
