The build dashboards skill turns AI agents into dashboard design experts:

- **Design methodology**: Decision-first dashboard design with overview-to-drilldown structure
- **Chart types**: Complete reference for statistic, time series, table, pie, log stream, heatmap, and more
- **APL patterns**: Golden signal queries, cardinality guardrails, and time-based aggregations
- **Smart filters**: Interactive filtering with cascading dropdowns

## Use build dashboards skill

The build dashboards skill activates automatically when you ask your AI agent to:

- Create or design dashboards
- Migrate Splunk dashboards to Axiom
- Configure chart types and options
- Build smart filters for interactive filtering

Example prompts:

- "Create a service health dashboard for the API"
- "Build a dashboard with error rate, latency percentiles, and traffic trends"
- "Add a smart filter dropdown for filtering by environment"
- "Migrate this Splunk dashboard to Axiom"

## Dashboard templates

The build dashboards skill includes pre-built templates:

| Template | Use case |
| --- | --- |
| `service-overview.json` | Single-service on-call dashboard with heatmap |
| `service-overview-with-filters.json` | Single-service dashboard with smart filter dropdowns |
| `api-health.json` | HTTP API with traffic, errors, and latency |
| `blank.json` | Minimal dashboard skeleton for custom dashboards |
