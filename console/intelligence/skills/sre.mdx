The SRE skill turns AI agents into expert SRE investigators:

- **Investigation methodology**: Hypothesis-driven debugging with systematic triage using Golden Signals and USE/RED methods
- **APL query patterns**: Reference materials for constructing effective Axiom queries
- **Memory system**: Persistent storage that learns from debugging sessions, capturing what works and what doesn't
- **API helpers**: Scripts for querying Axiom directly from the agent

<Prerequisites />

## Install SRE skill

Choose one of the following ways to install the SRE skill:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Quick install">

Install all Axiom skills at once for Claude Code, Cursor, and other Claude-compatible agents:

```bash
npx skills add axiomhq/skills
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Amp">

1. Clone the Axiom Skills repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/axiomhq/skills.git
    ```

1. Compress the `skills/sre` folder into a zip file.
1. Enable code execution in **Settings > Capabilities**.
1. Upload the zip file to your agent's capabilities in **Settings > Capabilities**.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Claude Code">

Clone the Axiom Skills repository and symlink the SRE skill to your Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axiomhq/skills.git ~/axiom-skills
ln -s ~/axiom-skills/skills/sre ~/.claude/skills/axiom-sre
```

For more information, see the [Claude Code documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).

</Tab>
<Tab title="Cursor">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axiomhq/skills.git ~/axiom-skills
ln -s ~/axiom-skills/skills/sre ~/.cursor/skills/axiom-sre
```

For more information, see the [Cursor documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills).

</Tab>
<Tab title="Codex">

Clone the Axiom Skills repository and symlink the SRE skill to your Codex skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axiomhq/skills.git ~/axiom-skills
ln -s ~/axiom-skills/skills/sre ~/.codex/skills/axiom-sre
```

For more information, see the [Codex documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/).

</Tab>
<Tab title="Other agents">

Clone the Axiom Skills repository and reference the SRE skill in your agent configuration:

## Use SRE skill

The SRE skill activates automatically when you ask your AI agent about:

- Incident response and debugging
- Root cause analysis
- Log investigation
- Production troubleshooting

Example prompts:

- "Investigate why API latency increased in the last hour"
- "Find the root cause of the 500 errors in production"
- "Analyze error patterns in the logs dataset"

## Memory system

The SRE skill learns from every debugging session. The memory system initializes automatically on first use. Memory persists at `~/.config/amp/memory/axiom-sre/` (global) or `.agents/memory/axiom-sre/` (project/local).

### Tell the agent to remember things

- `Remember this for next time.`
- `Save this query, it worked.`
- `Add to memory: the orders team uses #orders-oncall.`

### Learn automatically

The SRE skill automatically captures what works and what doesn't when:

- A query or approach finds the root cause.
- You correct it, and it records what didn't work and what did.
- A debugging session completes successfully.

### Customize with your own knowledge

Customize the SRE skill by adding your own knowledge to the knowledge base files:

- `kb/facts.md`: Team contacts, Slack channels, conventions.
- `kb/integrations.md`: Database connections, API endpoints.
- `kb/patterns.md`: Failure patterns you've seen before.
