The control costs skill helps AI agents optimize Axiom usage and reduce costs:

- **Waste identification**: Find unused columns, never-queried datasets, and high-volume low-value data
- **Query analysis**: Analyze query patterns to identify optimization opportunities
- **Dashboard deployment**: Deploy cost control dashboards with ingest trends, burn rate, and projections
- **Monitor creation**: Set up monitors for contract limits, spike detection, and reduction glidepaths
- **Analysis workflow**: Systematic approach to prioritize and analyze datasets by impact

## Use control costs skill

The control costs skill activates automatically when you ask your AI agent to:

- Reduce Axiom costs or find waste
- Set up cost control dashboards and monitors
- Analyze query coverage and unused data
- Track ingest spend and burn rate

Example prompts:

- "Help reduce Axiom costs"
- "Find unused columns in the datasets"
- "Set up cost control monitoring for the organization"
- "Which datasets are being paid for but never queried?"

## Cost control workflow

The control costs skill follows a phased approach:

| Phase | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Discovery | Capture baseline ingest statistics and build analysis queue |
| Dashboard | Deploy cost control dashboard with trends and projections |
| Monitors | Create monitors for contract limits and spike detection |
| Optimization | Analyze datasets to find waste and recommend actions |
| Glidepath | Track reduction progress with weekly threshold updates |
