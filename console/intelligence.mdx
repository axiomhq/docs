Axiom’s Console is evolving from a powerful space for human-led investigation to incorporate assistance that helps you reach insights faster. By combining Axiom's cost-efficient data platform with intelligence features, Axiom is transforming common workflows from reactive chores into proactive, machine-assisted actions.

This section covers the intelligence features built into the Axiom Console.

## Spotlight

Spotlight is an interactive analysis feature that helps you find the root cause faster.

Rather than reviewing data from a notable period event-by-event, Spotlight allows you to compare a subset against baseline automatically. Spotlight analyzes every field to surface the most significant differences, turning manual investigation into a fast, targeted discovery process.

## AI agent integrations

Axiom provides two complementary approaches for integrating AI agents with your data:

### Axiom MCP Server

Axiom MCP Server is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server implementation that enables AI agents to query your data using Axiom Processing Language (APL). MCP provides OAuth-based credential isolation where agents never see your tokens.

Learn more about [Axiom MCP Server](/console/intelligence/mcp-server).

### Skills

Skills are instruction files that give AI coding agents specialized capabilities. [Axiom SRE Skill](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-sre) turns AI agents into expert SRE investigators with hypothesis-driven methodology, APL query patterns, and a memory system that learns from past incidents. Skills work by embedding methodology and context directly into the agent's prompt.

## AI-assisted workflows

Axiom also includes several features that leverage AI to accelerate common workflows.

### Natural language querying

Ask questions of your data in plain English and have Axiom translate your request directly into a valid Axiom Processing Language (APL) query. This lowers the barrier to exploring your data and makes it easier for everyone on your team to find the answers they need.

Learn more about [generating queries using AI](/query-data/explore#generate-query-using-ai).

### AI-powered dashboard generation

Instead of building dashboards from scratch, you can describe your requirements in natural language and have Axiom generate a complete dashboard for you instantly. Axiom analyzes your events and goals to select the most appropriate visualizations.

### AI summaries in Spotlight

Spotlight provides you with clear, concise explanations of the key differences between selected and baseline data. This makes it easier to spot root causes, understand anomalies, and communicate findings to your team, without needing to pore over every visualization.
