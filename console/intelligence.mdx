Axiomâ€™s Console is evolving from a powerful space for human-led investigation to incorporate assistance that helps you reach insights faster. By combining Axiom's cost-efficient data platform with intelligence features, Axiom is transforming common workflows from reactive chores into proactive, machine-assisted actions.

This section covers the intelligence features built into the Axiom Console.

## Spotlight

Spotlight is an interactive analysis feature that helps you find the root cause faster.

Rather than reviewing data from a notable period event-by-event, Spotlight allows you to compare a subset against baseline automatically. Spotlight analyzes every field to surface the most significant differences, turning manual investigation into a fast, targeted discovery process.

## Axiom MCP Server

The Axiom MCP Server is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server implementation that enables AI agents to query your data using Axiom Processing Language (APL).

## AI-assisted workflows

Axiom also includes several features that leverage AI to accelerate common workflows.

### Natural language querying

Ask questions of your data in plain English and have Axiom translate your request directly into a valid Axiom Processing Language (APL) query. This lowers the barrier to exploring your data and makes it easier for everyone on your team to find the answers they need.

### AI-powered dashboard generation

Instead of building dashboards from scratch, you can describe your requirements in natural language and have Axiom generate a complete dashboard for you instantly. Axiom analyzes your events and goals to select the most appropriate visualizations.
